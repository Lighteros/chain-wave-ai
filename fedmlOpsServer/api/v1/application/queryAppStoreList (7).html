is a lightning-fast text-to-video generation model. It can generate videos more
than ten times faster than the original AnimateDiff. For more information,
please refer to our research paper: [AnimateDiff-Lightning: Cross-Model
Diffusion Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12706). We release the model
as part of the research.\n\nOur models are distilled from [AnimateDiff SD1.5
v2](https://huggingface.co/guoyww/animatediff). This repository contains
checkpoints for 1-step, 2-step, 4-step, and 8-step distilled models. The
generation quality of our 2-step, 4-step, and 8-step model is great. Our 1-step
model is only provided for research
purposes.","modelId":1,"dataId":1,"platformId":-1,"users":0,"favorites":0,"views":76,"requests":"1295","sort":null,"version":"v0-Mon
