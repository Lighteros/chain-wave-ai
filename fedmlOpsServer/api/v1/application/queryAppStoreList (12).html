The Llama 3 instruction tuned models are optimized for dialogue use cases and outperform many of the available open source chat models on common industry benchmarks. Further, in developing these models, we took great care to optimize helpfulness and safety.** **\n\n\\*\\*Model developers\\*\\* Meta\n\n\\*\\*Variations\\*\\* Llama 3 comes in two sizes — 8B and 70B parameters — in pre-trained and instruction tuned variants.\n\n\\*\\*Input\\*\\* Models input text only.\n\n\\*\\*Output\\*\\* Models generate text and code only.\n\n\\*\\*Model Architecture\\*\\* Llama 3 is an auto-regressive language model that uses an optimized transformer architecture. The tuned versions use supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) to align with human preferences for helpfulness and safety.\n\n<table>\n\n**  **<tr>\n\n**   **<td>\n\n**   **</td>\n\n**   **<td><strong>Training Data</strong>\n\n**   **</td>\n\n**   **<td><strong>Params</strong>\n\n**   **</td>\n\n**   **<td><strong>Context length</strong>\n\n**   **</td>\n\n**   **<td><strong>GQA</strong>\n\n**   **</td>\n\n**   **<td><strong>Token count</strong>\n\n**   **</td>\n\n**   **<td><strong>Knowledge cutoff</strong>\n\n**   **</td>\n\n**  **</tr>\n\n**  **<tr>\n\n**   **<td rowspan=\"2\" >Llama 3\n\n**   **</td>\n\n**   **<td rowspan=\"2\" >A new mix of publicly available online data.\n\n**   **</td>\n\n**   **<td>8B\n\n**   **</td>\n\n**   **<td>8k\n\n**   **</td>\n\n**   **<td>Yes\n\n**   **</td>\n\n**   **<td rowspan=\"2\" >15T+\n\n**   **</td>\n\n**   **<td>March, 2023\n\n**   **</td>\n\n**  **</tr>\n\n**  **<tr>\n\n**   **<td>70B\n\n**   **</td>\n\n**   **<td>8k\n\n**   **</td>\n\n**   **<td>Yes\n\n**   **</td>\n\n**   **<td>December, 2023\n\n**   **</td>\n\n**  **</tr>\n\n</table>\n\n\\*\\*Llama 3 family of models\\*\\*.

Instruction tuned models are intended for assistant-like chat, whereas pretrained models can be adapted for a variety of natural language generation tasks.\n\n\\*\\*Out-of-scope\\*\\* Use in any manner that violates applicable laws or regulations (including trade compliance laws). Use in any other way that is prohibited by the Acceptable Use Policy and Llama 3 Community License. Use in languages other than English\\*\\*.\n\n\\*\\*Note: Developers may fine-tune Llama 3 models for languages beyond English provided they comply with the Llama 3 Community License and the Acceptable Use Policy.\n\n## How to use\n\nThis repository contains two versions of Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct, for use with transformers and with the original \\`llama3\\` codebase.\n\n### Use with transformers\n\nSee the snippet below for usage with Transformers:\n\n\\`\\`\\`python\n\nimport transformers\n\nimport torch\n\nmodel\\_id = \"meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct\"\n\npipeline = transformers.pipeline(\n\n**    **\"text-generation\",\n\n**    **model=model\\_id,\n\n**    **model\\_kwargs={\"torch\\_dtype\": torch.bfloat16},\n\n**    **device=\"cuda\",\n\n)\n\nmessages = [\n\n**    **{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a pirate chatbot who always responds in pirate speak!\"},\n\n**    **{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Who are you?\"},\n\n]\n\nprompt = pipeline.tokenizer.apply\\_chat\\_template(\n\n**\t\t**messages,** **\n\n**\t\t**tokenize=False,** **\n\n**\t\t**add\\_generation\\_prompt=True\n\n)\n\nterminators = [\n\n**    **tokenizer.eos\\_token\\_id,\n\n**    **tokenizer.convert\\_tokens\\_to\\_ids(\"<|eot\\_id|>\")\n\n]\n\noutputs = pipeline(\n\n**    **prompt,\n\n**    **max\\_new\\_tokens=256,\n\n**    **eos\\_token\\_id=terminators,\n\n**    **do\\_sample=True,\n\n**    **temperature=0.6,\n\n**    **top\\_p=0.9,\n\n)\n\nprint(outputs[0][\"generated\\_text\"][len(prompt):])\n\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n### Use with \\`llama3\\`\n\nPlease, follow the instructions in the [repository](https://github.com/meta-llama/llama3).\n\nTo download Original checkpoints, see the example command below leveraging \\`huggingface-cli\\`:\n\n\\`\\`\\`\n\nhuggingface-cli download meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct --include \"original/\\*\" --local-dir Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct\n\n\\`\\`\\`\n\nFor Hugging Face support, we recommend using transformers or TGI, but a similar command works.\n\n## Hardware and Software\n\n\\*\\*Training Factors\\*\\* We used custom training libraries, Meta's Research SuperCluster, and production clusters for pretraining. Fine-tuning, annotation, and evaluation were also performed on third-party cloud compute.\n\n\\*\\*Carbon Footprint Pretraining utilized a cumulative\\*\\* 7.7M GPU hours of computation on hardware of type H100-80GB (TDP of 700W). Estimated total emissions were 2290 tCO2eq, 100% of which were offset by Meta’s sustainability program.\n\n<table>\n\n**  **<tr>\n\n**   **<td>\n\n**   **</td>\n\n**   **<td><strong>Time (GPU hours)</strong>\n\n**   **</td>\n\n**   **<td><strong>Power Consumption (W)</strong>\n\n**   **</td>\n\n**   **<td><strong>Carbon Emitted(tCO2eq)</strong>\n\n**   **</td>\n\n**  **</tr>\n\n**  **<tr>\n\n**   **<td>Llama 3 8B\n\n**   **</td>\n\n**   **<td>1.3M\n\n**   **</td>\n\n**   **<td>700\n\n**   **</td>\n\n**   **<td>390\n\n**   **</td>\n\n**  **</tr>\n\n**  **<tr>\n\n**   **<td>Llama 3 70B\n\n**   **</td>\n\n**   **<td>6.4M\n\n**   **</td>\n\n**   **<td>700\n\n**   **</td>\n\n**   **<td>1900\n\n**   **</td>\n\n**  **</tr>\n\n**  **<tr>\n\n**   **<td>Total\n\n**   **</td>\n\n**   **<td>7.7M\n\n**   **</td>\n\n**   **<td>\n\n**   **</td>\n\n**   **<td>2290\n\n**   **</td>\n\n**  **</tr>\n\n</table>\n\n\\*\\*CO2 emissions during pre-training\\*\\*. Time: total GPU time required for training each model. Power Consumption: peak power capacity per GPU device for the GPUs used adjusted for power usage efficiency. 100% of the emissions are directly offset by Meta's sustainability program, and because we are openly releasing these models, the pretraining costs do not need to be incurred by others.\n\n## Training Data\n\n\\*\\*Overview\\*\\* Llama 3 was pretrained on over 15 trillion tokens of data from publicly available sources. The fine-tuning data includes publicly available instruction datasets, as well as over 10M human-annotated examples. Neither the pretraining nor the fine-tuning datasets include Meta user data.\n\n\\*\\*Data Freshness\\*\\* The pretraining data has a cutoff of March 2023 for the 7B and December 2023 for the 70B models respectively.\n\n## Benchmarks\n\nIn this section, we report the results for Llama 3 models on standard automatic benchmarks. For all the evaluations, we use our internal evaluations library. For details on the methodology see [here](https://github.com/meta-llama/llama3/blob/main/eval\\_methodology.md).\n\n### Base pretrained models\n\n<table>\n\n**  **<tr>\n\n**

We are committed to Responsible AI development and took a series of steps to limit misuse and harm and support the open source community.\n\nFoundation models are widely capable technologies that are built to be used for a diverse range of applications. They are not designed to meet every developer preference on safety levels for all use cases, out-of-the-box, as those by their nature will differ across different applications.\n\nRather, responsible LLM-application deployment is achieved by implementing a series of safety best practices throughout the development of such applications, from the model pre-training, fine-tuning and the deployment of systems composed of safeguards to tailor the safety needs specifically to the use case and audience.\n\nAs part of the Llama 3 release, we updated our [Responsible Use Guide](https://llama.meta.com/responsible-use-guide/) to outline the steps and best practices for developers to implement model and system level safety for their application. We also provide a set of resources including [Meta Llama Guard 2](https://llama.meta.com/purple-llama/) and [Code Shield](https://llama.meta.com/purple-llama/) safeguards. These tools have proven to drastically reduce residual risks of LLM Systems, while maintaining a high level of helpfulness. We encourage developers to tune and deploy these safeguards according to their needs and we provide a [reference implementation](https://github.com/meta-llama/llama-recipes/tree/main/recipes/responsible\\_ai) to get you started.\n\n#### Llama 3-Instruct\n\nAs outlined in the Responsible Use Guide, some trade-off between model helpfulness and model alignment is likely unavoidable. Developers should exercise discretion about how to weigh the benefits of alignment and helpfulness for their specific use case and audience. Developers should be mindful of residual risks when using Llama models and leverage additional safety tools as needed to reach the right safety bar for their use case.\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Safety</span>\n\nFor our instruction tuned model, we conducted extensive red teaming exercises, performed adversarial evaluations and implemented safety mitigations techniques to lower residual risks. As with any Large Language Model, residual risks will likely remain and we recommend that developers assess these risks in the context of their use case. In parallel, we are working with the community to make AI safety benchmark standards transparent, rigorous and interpretable.\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Refusals</span>\n\nIn addition to residual risks, we put a great emphasis on model refusals to benign prompts. Over-refusing not only can impact the user experience but could even be harmful in certain contexts as well. We’ve heard the feedback from the developer community and improved our fine tuning to ensure that Llama 3 is significantly less likely to falsely refuse to answer prompts than Llama 2.\n\nWe built internal benchmarks and developed mitigations to limit false refusals making Llama 3 our most helpful model to date.\n\n#### Responsible release\n\nIn addition to responsible use considerations outlined above, we followed a rigorous process that requires us to take extra measures against misuse and critical risks before we make our release decision.\n\nMisuse\n\nIf you access or use Llama 3, you agree to the Acceptable Use Policy. The most recent copy of this policy can be found at [https://llama.meta.com/llama3/use-policy/](https://llama.meta.com/llama3/use-policy/).\n\n#### Critical risks\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">CBRNE</span> (Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and high yield Explosives)\n\nWe have conducted a two fold assessment of the safety of the model in this area:\n\n\\* Iterative testing during model training to assess the safety of responses related to CBRNE threats and other adversarial risks.\n\n\\* Involving external CBRNE experts to conduct an uplift test assessing the ability of the model to accurately provide expert knowledge and reduce barriers to potential CBRNE misuse, by reference to what can be achieved using web search (without the model).\n\n### <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Cyber Security </span>\n\nWe have evaluated Llama 3 with CyberSecEval, Meta’s cybersecurity safety eval suite, measuring Llama 3’s propensity to suggest insecure code when used as a coding assistant, and Llama 3’s propensity to comply with requests to help carry out cyber attacks, where attacks are defined by the industry standard MITRE ATT&CK cyber attack ontology. On our insecure coding and cyber attacker helpfulness tests, Llama 3 behaved in the same range or safer than models of [equivalent coding capability](https://huggingface.co/spaces/facebook/CyberSecEval).\n\n### <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Child Safety</span>\n\nChild Safety risk assessments were conducted using a team of experts, to assess the model’s capability to produce outputs that could result in Child Safety risks and inform on any necessary and appropriate risk mitigations via fine tuning. We leveraged those expert red teaming sessions to expand the coverage of our evaluation benchmarks through Llama 3 model development.**  **For Llama 3, we conducted new in-depth sessions using objective based methodologies to assess the model risks along multiple attack vectors. We also partnered with content specialists to perform red teaming exercises assessing potentially violating content while taking account of market specific nuances or experiences.\n\n### Community\n\nGenerative AI safety requires expertise and tooling, and we believe in the strength of the open community to accelerate its progress. We are active members of open consortiums, including the AI Alliance, Partnership in AI and MLCommons, actively contributing to safety standardization and transparency. We encourage the community to adopt taxonomies like the MLCommons Proof of Concept evaluation to facilitate collaboration and transparency on safety and content evaluations. Our Purple Llama tools are open sourced for the community to use and widely distributed across ecosystem partners including cloud service providers. We encourage community contributions to our [Github repository](https://github.com/meta-llama/PurpleLlama).\n\nFinally, we put in place a set of resources including an [output reporting mechanism](https://developers.facebook.com/llama\\_output\\_feedback) and [bug bounty program](https://www.facebook.com/whitehat) to continuously improve the Llama technology with the help of the community.\n\n## Ethical Considerations and Limitations\n\nThe core values of Llama 3 are openness, inclusivity and helpfulness. It is meant to serve everyone, and to work for a wide range of use cases. It is thus designed to be accessible to people across many different backgrounds, experiences and perspectives. Llama 3 addresses users and their needs as they are, without insertion unnecessary judgment or normativity, while reflecting the understanding that even content that may appear problematic in some cases can serve valuable purposes in others. It respects the dignity and autonomy of all users, especially in terms of the values of free thought and expression that power innovation and progress.\n\nBut Llama 3 is a new technology, and like any new technology, there are risks associated with its use. Testing conducted to date has been in English, and has not covered, nor could it cover, all scenarios. For these reasons, as with all LLMs, Llama 3’s potential outputs cannot be predicted in advance, and the model may in some instances produce inaccurate, biased or other objectionable responses to user prompts. Therefore, before deploying any applications of Llama 3 models, developers should perform safety testing and tuning tailored to their specific applications of the model. As outlined in the Responsible Use Guide, we recommend incorporating [Purple Llama](https://github.com/facebookresearch/PurpleLlama) solutions into your workflows and specifically [Llama Guard](https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/llama-guard-llm-based-input-output-safeguard-for-human-ai-conversations/) which provides a base model to filter input and output prompts to layer system-level safety on top of model-level safety.\n\nPlease see the Responsible Use Guide available at [http://llama.meta.com/responsible-use-guide](http://llama.meta.com/responsible-use-guide)\n\n## Citation instructions\n\n@article{llama3modelcard,\n\ntitle={Llama 3 Model Card},\n\nauthor={AI@Meta},\n\nyear={2024},\n\nurl = {https://github.com/meta-llama/llama3/blob/main/MODEL\\_CARD.md}\n\n}\n\n## Contributors\n\nAaditya Singh;

As researchers, we have grappled with the constraints of efficiently training and inferencing LLMs for years. Members of the Snowflake AI Research team pioneered systems such as [ZeRO](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.02054) and [DeepSpeed](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed), [PagedAttention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06180)  [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm), and [LLM360](https://www.llm360.ai/) which significantly reduced the cost of LLM training and inference, and open sourced them to make LLMs more accessible and cost-effective for the community.\n\nToday, the Snowflake AI Research Team is thrilled to introduce Snowflake Arctic, a top-tier enterprise-focused LLM that pushes the frontiers of cost-effective training and openness. Arctic is** *****efficiently intelligent and truly open.***\n\n* **Efficiently Intelligent:** Arctic excels at enterprise tasks such as SQL generation, coding and instruction following benchmarks even when compared to open source models trained with significantly higher compute budgets. In fact, it sets a new baseline for cost-effective training to enable Snowflake customers to create high-quality custom models for their enterprise needs at a low cost.\n* **Truly Open:** Apache 2.0 license provides ungated access to weights and code. In addition, we are also open sourcing all of our data recipes and research insights.\n\nSnowflake Arctic is available from Hugging Face, NVIDIA API catalog and Replicate today or via your model garden or catalog of choice, including Snowflake Cortex, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Lamini, Perplexity and Together over the coming days.\n\n![](https://www.snowflake.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/figure-1-training-efficiency-3.png)\nFig 1. Enterprise intelligence – average of Coding (HumanEval+ and MBPP+), SQL Generation (Spider), and Instruction following (IFEval) –  vs. Training cost\n\n### **Top-tier enterprise intelligence at incredibly low training cost**\n\nAt Snowflake, we see a consistent pattern in AI needs and use cases from our enterprise customers. Enterprises want to use LLMs to build conversational SQL data copilots, code copilots and RAG chatbots. From a metrics perspective, this translates to LLMs that excel at SQL, code, complex instruction following and the ability to produce grounded answers. We capture these abilities into a single metric we call **enterprise intelligence** by taking an average of Coding (HumanEval+ and MBPP+), SQL Generation (Spider) and Instruction following (IFEval).\n\nArctic offers top-tier enterprise intelligence among open source LLMs, and it does so using a training compute budget of roughly under \\$2 million (less than 3K GPU weeks). This means Arctic is more capable than other open source models trained with a similar compute budget. More importantly, it excels at enterprise intelligence, even when compared to those trained with a significantly higher compute budget. The high training efficiency of Arctic also means that Snowflake customers and the AI community at large can train custom models in a much more affordable way.\n\nAs seen in Figure 1, Arctic is on par or better than both LLAMA 3 8B and LLAMA 2 70B on enterprise metrics, while using less than ½ of the training compute budget. Similarly, despite using 17x less compute budget, Arctic is on par with Llama3 70B in enterprise metrics like Coding (HumanEval+ & MBPP+), SQL (Spider) and Instruction Following (IFEval). It does so while remaining competitive on overall performance. For example, despite using 7x less compute than DBRX it remains competitive on Language Understanding and Reasoning (a collection of 11 metrics) while being better in Math (GSM8K). For a detailed breakdown of results by individual benchmark, see the Metrics section.\n\n![](https://www.snowflake.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/table-1-4.png)\nTable 1 Model architecture and training compute for Arctic, Llama-2 70B, DBRX and Mixtral 8x22B.  Training compute is proportional to the product of active parameters and training tokens.\n\n### **Training efficiency**\n\nTo achieve this level of training efficiency, Arctic uses a unique Dense-MoE Hybrid transformer architecture. It combines a 10B dense transformer model with a residual 128×3.66B MoE MLP resulting in 480B total and 17B active parameters chosen using a top-2 gating. It was designed and trained using the following three key insights and innovations:\n\n1) ***Many-but-condensed experts with more expert choices:* In late 2021, the **[DeepSpeed team demonstrated](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05596) that MoE can be applied to auto-regressive LLMs to significantly improve model quality without increasing compute cost.\n\nIn designing Arctic, we noticed, based on the above, that the improvement of the model quality depended primarily on the number of experts and the total number of parameters in the MoE model, and the number of ways in which these experts can be combined together.\n\nBased on this insight, Arctic is designed to have 480B parameters spread across 128 fine-grained experts and uses top-2 gating to choose 17B active parameters. In contrast, recent MoE models are built with significantly fewer experts as shown in Table 2.  Intuitively, Arctic leverages a large number of total parameters and many experts to enlarge the model capacity for top-tier intelligence, while it judiciously chooses among many-but-condensed experts and engages a moderate number of active parameters for resource-efficient training and inference.\n\n![](https://www.snowflake.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/figure-2-Standard-MoE-Architecture-vs-Arctic-4.png)\nFigure 2. Standard MoE Architecture vs. Arctic\n\n2)*Architecture and System Co-design:* Training vanilla MoE architecture with a large number of experts is very inefficient even on the most powerful AI training hardware due to high all-to-all communication overhead among experts. However, it is possible to hide this overhead if the communication can be overlapped with computation.\n\nOur second insight is that combining a dense transformer with a residual MoE component (Fig 2) in the Arctic architecture enables our training system to achieve good training efficiency via communication computation overlap, hiding a big portion of the communication overhead.\n\n3)*Enterprise-Focused Data Curriculum:* Excelling at enterprise metrics like Code Generation and SQL requires a vastly different data curriculum than training models for generic metrics. Over hundreds of small-scale ablations, we learned that generic skills like common sense reasoning can be learned in the beginning, while more complex metrics like coding, math and SQL can be learned effectively towards the latter part of the training. One can draw analogies to human life and education, where we acquire capabilities from simpler to harder. As such, Arctic was trained with a three-stage curriculum each with a different data composition focusing on generic skills in the first phase (1T Tokens), and enterprise-focused skills in the latter two phases (1.5T and 1T tokens). A high-level summary of our dynamic curriculum is shown here.\n\n![](https://www.snowflake.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/table-2-4.png)\nTable 2. Dynamic data composition for three-phase training of Arctic with emphasis on enterprise intelligence.\n\n### **Inference efficiency**\n\n![](https://www.snowflake.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/figure-3-inference-efficiency-3.png)\nFigure 3. Enterprise intelligence – average of Coding (HumanEval+ and MBPP+), SQL Generation (Spider), and Instruction following (IFEval) vs. Active Parameters during Inference\n\nTraining efficiency represents only one side of the efficient intelligence of Arctic. Inference efficiency is equally critical to allow for the practical deployment of the model at a low cost. Arctic represents a leap in MoE model scale, using more experts and total parameters than any other open sourced auto-regressive MoE model. As such, several system insights and innovations are necessary to run inference on Arctic efficiently:\n\na) At interactive inference of a small batch size, e.g., batch size of 1, an MoE model’s inference latency is bottlenecked by the time it takes to read all the active parameters, where the inference is memory bandwidth bounded. At this batch size, Arctic (17B active parameters) can have up to 4x less memory reads than Code-Llama 70B, and up to 2.5x less than Mixtral 8x22B (44B active parameters), leading to faster inference performance.\n\nWe have collaborated with NVIDIA and worked with [NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-tensorrt-llm-supercharges-large-language-model-inference-on-nvidia-h100-gpus/) and the [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) teams to provide a preliminary implementation of Arctic for interactive inference. With FP8 quantization, we can fit Arctic within a single GPU node. While far from fully optimized, at a batch size of 1, Arctic has a throughput of over 70+ tokens/second for effective interactive serving.\n\nb) As the batch size increases significantly e.g., thousands of tokens per forward pass, Arctic switches from being memory bandwidth bound to compute bound, where the inference is bottlenecked by the active parameters per token. At this point, Arctic incurs 4x less compute than CodeLlama 70B and Llama 3 70B.\n\nTo enable compute bound inference and high relative throughput that corresponds to the small number of active parameters in Arctic (as shown in Fig 3), a large batch size is needed. Achieving this requires having enough KV cache memory to support the large batch size while also having enough memory to store nearly 500B parameters for the model. While challenging, this can be achieved with two-node inference using a combination of system optimizations such as FP8 weights, split-fuse and continuous batching, tensor parallelism within a node and pipeline parallelism across nodes.\n\nWe have worked closely with NVIDIA to optimize inference for  NVIDIA NIM microservices powered by TensorRT-LLM. In parallel, we are working with the vLLM community, and our in-house development team is also enabling efficient inference of Arctic for enterprise use cases in the coming weeks.\n\n### Truly open\n\nArctic was built upon the collective experiences of our diverse team, as well as major insights and learnings from the community. Open collaboration is key to innovation, and Arctic would not have been possible without open source code and open research insights from the community. We are thankful to the community and eager to give back our own learnings to enrich the collective knowledge and empower others to succeed.\n\nOur commitment to a truly open ecosystem goes beyond open weights and code but also having open research insights and open source recipes.\n\n#### Open research insights\n\nThe construction of Arctic has unfolded along two distinct trajectories: the open path, which we navigated swiftly thanks to the wealth of community insights, and the hard path, which is characterized by the segments of research that lacked prior community insights, necessitating intensive debugging and numerous ablations.\n\nWith this release, we’re not just unveiling the model; we’re also sharing our research insights through a comprehensive ‘cookbook’ that opens up our findings from the hard path. The cookbook is designed to expedite the learning process for anyone looking to build world-class MoE models. It offers a blend of high-level insights and granular technical details in crafting an LLM akin to Arctic so you can build your desired intelligence efficiently and economically — guided by the open path instead of the hard one.\n\nThe cookbook spans a breadth of topics, including pre-training, fine-tuning, inference and evaluation, and also delves into modeling, data, systems and infrastructure. You can preview [the table of contents](https://medium.com/@snowflake_ai_research/snowflake-arctic-cookbook-series-exploring-mixture-of-experts-moe-c7d6b8f14d16), which outlines over 20 subjects. We will be releasing corresponding Medium.com blog posts daily over the next month. For instance, we’ll disclose our strategies for sourcing and refining web data in “What data to use?”  We’ll discuss our data composition and curriculum in “How to compose data.” Our exploration of MoE architecture variations will be detailed in “Advanced MoE architecture,” discussing the co-design of model architecture and system performance. And for those curious about LLM evaluation, our “How to evaluate and compare model quality — less straightforward than you think” will shed light on the unexpected complexities we encountered.\n\nThrough this initiative, we aspire to contribute to an open community where collective learning and advancement are the norms to push the boundaries of this field further.\n\n#### Open source serving code\n\n* We are releasing model checkpoints for both the base and instruct-tuned versions of Arctic under an Apache 2.0 license. This means you can use them freely in your own research, prototypes and products.\n* Our LoRA-based fine-tuning pipeline, complete with a recipe, allows for efficient model tuning on a single node.\n* In collaboration with NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM and vLLM, we are developing initial inference implementations for Arctic, optimized for interactive use with a batch size of one. We are excited to work with the community to tackle the complexities of high-batch size inference of really large MoE models.\n* Arctic is trained using a 4K attention context window. We are developing an attention-sinks-based sliding window implementation to support unlimited sequence generation capability in the coming weeks. We look forward to working with the community to extend to a 32K attention window in the near future.\n\n##### Metrics\n\nOur focus from a metrics perspective is primarily on what we call **enterprise intelligence** metrics, a collection of skills that are critical for enterprise customers that includes, Coding (HumanEval+ and MBPP+), SQL Generation (Spider) and Instruction following (IFEval).\n\nAt the same time, it is equally important to evaluate LLMs on the metrics the research community evaluates them on. This includes world knowledge, common sense reasoning and math capabilities. We refer to these metrics as **academic benchmarks**​.\n\nHere is a comparison of Arctic with multiple open source models across enterprise and academic metrics:\n\n![](https://www.snowflake.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/figure-4-barchart-metrics-3-scaled.jpg)\n\nFor enterprise metrics, Arctic demonstrates top-tier performance compared to all other open source models regardless of the compute class. For other metrics, it achieves top-tier performance at its compute class and even remains competitive with models trained with higher compute budgets. Snowflake Arctic is the best open source model for off-the-shelf enterprise use cases. And if you are looking to train your own model from scratch at the lowest total cost of ownership (TCO), the training infrastructure and systems optimization descriptions in our cookbook should be of great interest.\n\nFor academic benchmarks, there has been a focus on world knowledge metrics such as MMLU to represent model performance. With high-quality web and STEM data, MMLU monotonically moves up as a function of training FLOPS. Since one objective for Arctic was to optimize for training efficiency while keeping the training budget small, a natural consequence is lower MMLU performance compared to recent top-tier models. In line with this insight, we expect our ongoing training run at a higher training compute budget than Arctic to exceed Arctic’s MMLU performance. We note that performance on MMLU world knowledge doesn’t necessarily correlate with our focus on enterprise intelligence.\n\n![](https://www.snowflake.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/table-3-5.png)\nTable 3.

We are eager to work with the community as we develop the next generation in the Arctic family of models. Join us at our Data Cloud Summit on June 3-6 to learn more.\n\nHere’s how we can collaborate on Arctic starting today:\n\n* Go to **[Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/Snowflake/snowflake-arctic-instruct) to directly download Arctic and use our **[Github repo](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/snowflake-arctic) for inference and fine-tuning recipes.\n* For a serverless experience in Snowflake Cortex, Snowflake customers with a payment method on file will be able to access Snowflake Arctic for free until June 3. **[Daily limits apply](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowflake-cortex/llm-functions).\n* Access Arctic via your model garden or catalog of choice including Amazon Web Services (AWS), Lamini, Microsoft Azure, **[NVIDIA API catalog](https://build.nvidia.com/snowflake/arctic), Perplexity,** [Replicate](https://replicate.com/snowflake/snowflake-arctic-instruct) and Together AI over the coming days.\n* Chat with Arctic! Try a live demo now on [Streamlit Community Cloud](https://arctic.streamlit.app/) or on [Hugging Face Streamlit Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Snowflake/snowflake-arctic-st-demo), with an API powered by our friends at Replicate.\n* Get mentorship and credits to help you build your own Arctic-powered applications during our [Arctic-themed Community Hackathon](https://arctic-streamlit-hackathon.devpost.com/).\n\nAnd finally, don’t forget to read the first edition of our [cookbook](https://medium.com/@snowflake_ai_research/snowflake-arctic-cookbook-series-exploring-mixture-of-experts-moe-c7d6b8f14d16) recipes to learn more about how to build your own custom MoE models in the most cost-effective way possible.\n\n### Acknowledgments\n\nWe would like to thank AWS for their collaboration and partnership in building Arctic’s training cluster and infrastructure, and NVIDIA for their collaboration in enabling Arctic support on NVIDIA NIM with TensorRT-LLM.  We also thank the open source community for producing the models, datasets and dataset recipe insights we could build on top of to make this release possible. We would also like to thank our partners in AWS, Microsoft Azure, NVIDIA API catalog, Lamini, Perplexity, Replicate and Together AI for their collaboration in making Arctic available\n\n1. The 11 metrics for Language Understanding and Reasoning include ARC-Easy, ARC-Challenge, BoolQ, CommonsenseQA, COPA, HellaSwag, LAMBADA, OpenBookQA, PIQA, RACE and WinoGrande.\n2. Evaluation scores for HumanEval+/MBPP+ v0.1.0 were obtained assuming (1) bigcode-evaluation-harness using model-specific chat templates and aligned post-processing, (2) greedy decoding. We evaluated all models with our pipeline to ensure consistency. We validated that our evaluations results are consistent with [EvalPlus leaderboard](https://evalplus.github.io/leaderboard.html). In fact, our pipeline produces numbers that are a few points higher than the numbers in EvalPlus for all models giving us confidence that we are evaluating each model in the best way possible.","modelId":1,"dataId":1,"platformId":-1,"users":0,"favorites":0,"views":48,"requests":"0","sort":null,"version":"v1-Thu Apr 25 22:25:37 GMT 2024","tags":["Text2Text Generation"],"playground":false,"createTime":"2024-04-25T22:26:40","updateBy":"Snowflake","updateTime":"2024-04-25T22:26:46"},{"id":1020,"versionId":4863,"owner":"Equall","applicationName":"Saul-Instruct-v1","jobType":2,"jobSubType":null,"accessPermission":0,"pictureUrl":"https://fedml.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/1712798254124equallLogo.png","description":"# Equall/Saul-Instruct-v1\n\nThis is the instruct model for Equall/Saul-Instruct-v1, a large instruct language model tailored for Legal domain.

This model card has been automatically generated.\n\n* **Developed by:** Equall.ai in collaboration with CentraleSupelec, Sorbonne Université, Instituto Superior Técnico and NOVA School of Law\n* **Model type:** 7B\n* **Language(s) (NLP):** English\n* **License:** MIT\n\n### Model Sources\n\n* **Paper:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03883](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03883)\n\n## Uses\n\nYou can use it for legal use cases that involves generation.\n\nHere's how you can run the model using the pipeline() function from \uD83E\uDD17 Transformers:\n\n```python\n# Install transformers from source - only needed for versions <= v4.34\n# pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.git\n# pip install accelerate\n\nimport torch\nfrom transformers import pipeline\n\npipe = pipeline(\"text-generation\", model=\"Equall/Saul-Instruct-v1\", torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16, device_map=\"auto\")\n# We use the tokenizer’s chat template to format each message - see https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/chat_templating\nmessages = [\n    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"[YOUR QUERY GOES HERE]\"},\n]\nprompt = pipe.tokenizer.apply_chat_template(messages, tokenize=False, add_generation_prompt=True)\noutputs = pipe(prompt, max_new_tokens=256, do_sample=False)\nprint(outputs[0][\"generated_text\"])\n```\n\n## Bias, Risks, and Limitations\n\nThis model is built upon the technology of LLM, which comes with inherent limitations. It may occasionally generate inaccurate or nonsensical outputs. Furthermore, being a 7B model, it's anticipated to exhibit less robust performance compared to larger models, such as the 70B variant.\n\n## Citation\n\n**BibTeX:**\n\n```bibtex\n@misc{colombo2024saullm7b,\n      title={SaulLM-7B: A pioneering Large Language Model for Law}, \n      author={Pierre Colombo and Telmo Pessoa Pires and Malik Boudiaf and Dominic Culver and Rui Melo and Caio Corro and Andre F.

By employing this model, you acknowledge and consent to adhere the terms and conditions outlined in the Meta license.*\n\nMeta developed and publicly released the Llama 2 family of large language models (LLMs), a collection of pretrained and fine-tuned generative text models ranging in scale from 7 billion to 70 billion parameters. Our fine-tuned LLMs, called Llama-2-Chat, are optimized for dialogue use cases. Llama-2-Chat models outperform open-source chat models on most benchmarks we tested, and in our human evaluations for helpfulness and safety, are on par with some popular closed-source models like ChatGPT and PaLM.\n\n**Model Developers** Meta\n\n**Variations** Llama 2 comes in a range of parameter sizes — 7B, 13B, and 70B — as well as pretrained and fine-tuned variations.\n\n**Input** Models input text only.\n\n**Output** Models generate text only.\n\n**Model Architecture** Llama 2 is an auto-regressive language model that uses an optimized transformer architecture. The tuned versions use supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) to align to human preferences for helpfulness and safety.\n\n|         | Training Data                                 | Params | Content Length | GQA | Tokens | LR                    |\n|---------|-----------------------------------------------|--------|----------------|-----|--------|-----------------------|\n| Llama 2 | *A new mix of publicly available online data* | 7B     | 4k             | N   | 2.0T   | 3.0 x 10-4 |\n| Llama 2 | *A new mix of publicly available online data* | 13B    | 4k             | N   | 2.0T   | 3.0 x 10-4 |\n| Llama 2 | *A new mix of publicly available online data* | 70B    | 4k             | Y   | 2.0T   | 1.5 x 10-4 |\n\n*Llama 2 family of models.* Token counts refer to pretraining data only. All models are trained with a global batch-size of 4M tokens. Bigger models -  70B -- use Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) for improved inference scalability.\n\n**Model Dates** Llama 2 was trained between January 2023 and July 2023.\n\n**Status** This is a static model trained on an offline dataset. Future versions of the tuned models will be released as we improve model safety with community feedback.\n\n**License** A custom commercial license is available at: [https://ai.meta.com/resources/models-and-libraries/llama-downloads/](https://ai.meta.com/resources/models-and-libraries/llama-downloads/)\n\n**Research Paper** [\"Llama-2: Open Foundation and Fine-tuned Chat Models\"](arxiv.org/abs/2307.09288)\n\n## Intended Use\n\n**Intended Use Cases** Llama 2 is intended for commercial and research use in English. Tuned models are intended for assistant-like chat, whereas pretrained models can be adapted for a variety of natural language generation tasks.\n\nTo get the expected features and performance for the chat versions, a specific formatting needs to be followed, including the `INST` and `<<SYS>>` tags, `BOS` and `EOS` tokens, and the whitespaces and breaklines in between (we recommend calling `strip()` on inputs to avoid double-spaces). See our reference code in github for details: [`chat_completion`](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama/blob/main/llama/generation.py#L212).\n\n**Out-of-scope Uses** Use in any manner that violates applicable laws or regulations (including trade compliance laws).Use in languages other than English. Use in any other way that is prohibited by the Acceptable Use Policy and Licensing Agreement for Llama 2.\n\n## Hardware and Software\n\n**Training Factors** We used custom training libraries, Meta's Research Super Cluster, and production clusters for pretraining. Fine-tuning, annotation, and evaluation were also performed on third-party cloud compute.\n\n**Carbon Footprint** Pretraining utilized a cumulative 3.3M GPU hours of computation on hardware of type A100-80GB (TDP of 350-400W). Estimated total emissions were 539 tCO2eq, 100% of which were offset by Meta’s sustainability program.\n\n||Time (GPU hours)|Power Consumption (W)|Carbon Emitted(tCO2eq)|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Llama 2 7B|184320|400|31.22|\n|Llama 2 13B|368640|400|62.44|\n|Llama 2 70B|1720320|400|291.42|\n|Total|3311616||539.00|\n\n**CO<sub>2</sub> emissions during pretraining.** Time: total GPU time required for training each model.

The fine-tuning data includes publicly available instruction datasets, as well as over one million new human-annotated examples. Neither the pretraining nor the fine-tuning datasets include Meta user data.\n\n**Data Freshness** The pretraining data has a cutoff of September 2022, but some tuning data is more recent, up to July 2023.\n\n## Evaluation Results\n\nIn this section, we report the results for the Llama 1 and Llama 2 models on standard academic benchmarks.For all the evaluations, we use our internal evaluations library.\n\n|Model|Size|Code|Commonsense Reasoning|World Knowledge|Reading Comprehension|Math|MMLU|BBH|AGI Eval|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Llama 1|7B|14.1|60.8|46.2|58.5|6.95|35.1|30.3|23.9|\n|Llama 1|13B|18.9|66.1|52.6|62.3|10.9|46.9|37.0|33.9|\n|Llama 1|33B|26.0|70.0|58.4|67.6|21.4|57.8|39.8|41.7|\n|Llama 1|65B|30.7|70.7|60.5|68.6|30.8|63.4|43.5|47.6|\n|Llama 2|7B|16.8|63.9|48.9|61.3|14.6|45.3|32.6|29.3|\n|Llama 2|13B|24.5|66.9|55.4|65.8|28.7|54.8|39.4|39.1|\n|Llama 2|70B|**37.5**|**71.9**|**63.6**|**69.4**|**35.2**|**68.9**|**51.2**|**54.2**|\n\n**Overall performance on grouped academic benchmarks.** *Code:* We report the average pass@1 scores of our models on HumanEval and MBPP. *Commonsense Reasoning:* We report the average of PIQA, SIQA, HellaSwag, WinoGrande, ARC easy and challenge, OpenBookQA, and CommonsenseQA.

Testing conducted to date has been in English, and has not covered, nor could it cover all scenarios. For these reasons, as with all LLMs, Llama 2’s potential outputs cannot be predicted in advance, and the model may in some instances produce inaccurate, biased or other objectionable responses to user prompts. Therefore, before deploying any applications of Llama 2, developers should perform safety testing and tuning tailored to their specific applications of the model.\n\nPlease see the Responsible Use Guide available at [https://ai.meta.com/llama/responsible-use-guide/](https://ai.meta.com/llama/responsible-use-guide)\n\n## Reporting Issues\n\nPlease report any software “bug,” or other problems with the models through one of the following means:\n\n- Reporting issues with the model: [github.com/facebookresearch/llama](http://github.com/facebookresearch/llama)\n- Reporting problematic content generated by the model: [developers.facebook.com/llama_output_feedback](http://developers.facebook.com/llama_output_feedback)\n- Reporting bugs and security concerns: [facebook.com/whitehat/info](http://facebook.com/whitehat/info)\n\n## Llama Model Index\n\n|Model|Llama2|Llama2-hf|Llama2-chat|Llama2-chat-hf|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|7B| [Link](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b) | [Link](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf) | [Link](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat) | [Link](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf)|\n|13B| [Link](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-13b) | [Link](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-hf) | [Link](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat) | [Link](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf)|\n|70B| [Link](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-70b) | [Link](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-hf) | [Link](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat) | [Link](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf)|","modelId":1,"dataId":1,"platformId":-1,"users":0,"favorites":0,"views":281,"requests":"0","sort":null,"version":"v3-Thu Feb 29 20:30:56 GMT 2024","tags":["Text2Text Generation"],"playground":false,"createTime":"2024-02-29T20:31:19","updateBy":"meta","updateTime":"2024-02-29T20:31:25"},{"id":518,"versionId":3912,"owner":"microsoft","applicationName":"phi-2","jobType":2,"jobSubType":null,"accessPermission":0,"pictureUrl":"https://fedml.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/1705487818197Phi-2.webp","description":"## Model Summary\n\nPhi-2 is a Transformer with **2.7 billion** parameters. It was trained using the same data sources as [Phi-1.5](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/phi-1.5), augmented with a new data source that consists of various NLP synthetic texts and filtered websites (for safety and educational value). When assessed against benchmarks testing common sense, language understanding, and logical reasoning, Phi-2 showcased a nearly state-of-the-art performance among models with less than 13 billion parameters.\n\nOur model hasn't been fine-tuned through reinforcement learning from human feedback. The intention behind crafting this open-source model is to provide the research community with a non-restricted small model to explore vital safety challenges, such as reducing toxicity, understanding societal biases, enhancing controllability, and more.\n\n## Intended Uses\n\nGiven the nature of the training data, the Phi-2 model is best suited for prompts using the QA format, the chat format, and the code format.\n\n### QA Format:\n\nYou can provide the prompt as a standalone question as follows:\n\n```markdown\nWrite a detailed analogy between mathematics and a lighthouse.\n```\n\nwhere the model generates the text after \".\" .\nTo encourage the model to write more concise answers, you can also try the following QA format using \"Instruct: \\<prompt\\>\\nOutput:\"\n\n```markdown\nInstruct: Write a detailed analogy between mathematics and a lighthouse.\nOutput: Mathematics is like a lighthouse. Just as a lighthouse guides ships safely to shore, mathematics provides a guiding light in the world of numbers and logic. It helps us navigate through complex problems and find solutions. Just as a lighthouse emits a steady beam of light, mathematics provides a consistent framework for reasoning and problem-solving. It illuminates the path to understanding and helps us make sense of the world around us.\n```\n\nwhere the model generates the text after \"Output:\".\n\n### Chat Format:\n\n```markdown\nAlice: I don't know why, I'm struggling to maintain focus while studying. Any suggestions?\nBob: Well, have you tried creating a study schedule and sticking to it?\nAlice: Yes, I have, but it doesn't seem to help much.\nBob: Hmm, maybe you should try studying in a quiet environment, like the library.\nAlice: ...\n```\n\nwhere the model generates the text after the first \"Bob:\".\n\n### Code Format:\n\n```python\ndef print_prime(n):\n   \"\"\"\n   Print all primes between 1 and n\n   \"\"\"\n   primes = []\n   for num in range(2, n+1):\n       is_prime = True\n       for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(num))+1):\n           if num % i == 0:\n               is_prime = False\n               break\n       if is_prime:\n           primes.append(num)\n   print(primes)\n```\n\nwhere the model generates the text after the comments.\n\n**Notes:**\n\n* Phi-2 is intended for QA, chat, and code purposes. The model-generated text/code should be treated as a starting point rather than a definitive solution for potential use cases. Users should be cautious when employing these models in their applications.\n* Direct adoption for production tasks without evaluation is out of scope of this project. As a result, the Phi-2 model has not been tested to ensure that it performs adequately for any production-level application. Please refer to the limitation sections of this document for more details.\n\n## Limitations of Phi-2\n\n* Generate Inaccurate Code and Facts: The model may produce incorrect code snippets and statements. Users should treat these outputs as suggestions or starting points, not as definitive or accurate solutions.\n* Limited Scope for code: Majority of Phi-2 training data is based in Python and use common packages such as \"typing, math, random, collections, datetime, itertools\". If the model generates Python scripts that utilize other packages or scripts in other languages, we strongly recommend users manually verify all API uses.\n* Unreliable Responses to Instruction: The model has not undergone instruction fine-tuning. As a result, it may struggle or fail to adhere to intricate or nuanced instructions provided by users.\n* Language Limitations: The model is primarily designed to understand standard English. Informal English, slang, or any other languages might pose challenges to its comprehension, leading to potential misinterpretations or errors in response.\n* Potential Societal Biases: Phi-2 is not entirely free from societal biases despite efforts in assuring training data safety. There's a possibility it may generate content that mirrors these societal biases, particularly if prompted or instructed to do so. We urge users to be aware of this and to exercise caution and critical thinking when interpreting model outputs.\n* Toxicity: Despite being trained with carefully selected data, the model can still produce harmful content if explicitly prompted or instructed to do so. We chose to release the model to help the open-source community develop the most effective ways to reduce the toxicity of a model directly after pretraining.\n* Verbosity: Phi-2 being a base model often produces irrelevant or extra text and responses following its first answer to user prompts within a single turn. This is due to its training dataset being primarily textbooks, which results in textbook-like responses.\n\n## Training\n\n### Model\n\n* Architecture: a Transformer-based model with next-word prediction objective\n* Context length: 2048 tokens\n* Dataset size: 250B tokens, combination of NLP synthetic data created by AOAI GPT-3.5 and filtered web data from Falcon RefinedWeb and SlimPajama, which was assessed by AOAI GPT-4.\n* Training tokens: 1.4T tokens\n* GPUs: 96xA100-80G\n* Training time: 14 days\n\n### Software\n\n* [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch)\n* [DeepSpeed](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed)\n* [Flash-Attention](https://github.com/HazyResearch/flash-attention)\n\n### License\n\nThe model is licensed under the [MIT license](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/phi-2/resolve/main/LICENSE).\n\n## Trademarks\n\nThis project may contain trademarks or logos for projects, products, or services.

This is the repository for the 7B fine-tuned model, optimized for dialogue use cases and converted for the Hugging Face Transformers format. Links to other models can be found in the index at the bottom.\n\n## Model Details\n\n*Note: Use of this model is governed by the [Meta license](https://ai.meta.com/llama/use-policy/). By employing this model, you acknowledge and consent to adhere the terms and conditions outlined in the Meta license.*\n\nMeta developed and publicly released the Llama 2 family of large language models (LLMs), a collection of pretrained and fine-tuned generative text models ranging in scale from 7 billion to 70 billion parameters. Our fine-tuned LLMs, called Llama-2-Chat, are optimized for dialogue use cases. Llama-2-Chat models outperform open-source chat models on most benchmarks we tested, and in our human evaluations for helpfulness and safety, are on par with some popular closed-source models like ChatGPT and PaLM.\n\n**Model Developers** Meta\n\n**Variations** Llama 2 comes in a range of parameter sizes — 7B, 13B, and 70B — as well as pretrained and fine-tuned variations.\n\n**Input** Models input text only.\n\n**Output** Models generate text only.\n\n**Model Architecture** Llama 2 is an auto-regressive language model that uses an optimized transformer architecture. The tuned versions use supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) to align to human preferences for helpfulness and safety.\n\n|         | Training Data                                 | Params | Content Length | GQA | Tokens | LR                    |\n|---------|-----------------------------------------------|--------|----------------|-----|--------|-----------------------|\n| Llama 2 | *A new mix of publicly available online data* | 7B     | 4k             | N   | 2.0T   | 3.0 x 10-4 |\n| Llama 2 | *A new mix of publicly available online data* | 13B    | 4k             | N   | 2.0T   | 3.0 x 10-4 |\n| Llama 2 | *A new mix of publicly available online data* | 70B    | 4k             | Y   | 2.0T   | 1.5 x 10-4 |\n\n*Llama 2 family of models.* Token counts refer to pretraining data only. All models are trained with a global batch-size of 4M tokens. Bigger models -  70B -- use Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) for improved inference scalability.\n\n**Model Dates** Llama 2 was trained between January 2023 and July 2023.\n\n**Status** This is a static model trained on an offline dataset. Future versions of the tuned models will be released as we improve model safety with community feedback.\n\n**License** A custom commercial license is available at: [https://ai.meta.com/resources/models-and-libraries/llama-downloads/](https://ai.meta.com/resources/models-and-libraries/llama-downloads/)\n\n**Research Paper** [\"Llama-2: Open Foundation and Fine-tuned Chat Models\"](arxiv.org/abs/2307.09288)\n\n## Intended Use\n\n**Intended Use Cases** Llama 2 is intended for commercial and research use in English. Tuned models are intended for assistant-like chat, whereas pretrained models can be adapted for a variety of natural language generation tasks.\n\nTo get the expected features and performance for the chat versions, a specific formatting needs to be followed, including the `INST` and `<<SYS>>` tags, `BOS` and `EOS` tokens, and the whitespaces and breaklines in between (we recommend calling `strip()` on inputs to avoid double-spaces). See our reference code in github for details: [`chat_completion`](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama/blob/main/llama/generation.py#L212).\n\n**Out-of-scope Uses** Use in any manner that violates applicable laws or regulations (including trade compliance laws).Use in languages other than English. Use in any other way that is prohibited by the Acceptable Use Policy and Licensing Agreement for Llama 2.\n\n## Hardware and Software\n\n**Training Factors** We used custom training libraries, Meta's Research Super Cluster, and production clusters for pretraining. Fine-tuning, annotation, and evaluation were also performed on third-party cloud compute.\n\n**Carbon Footprint** Pretraining utilized a cumulative 3.3M GPU hours of computation on hardware of type A100-80GB (TDP of 350-400W). Estimated total emissions were 539 tCO2eq, 100% of which were offset by Meta’s sustainability program.\n\n||Time (GPU hours)|Power Consumption (W)|Carbon Emitted(tCO2eq)|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Llama 2 7B|184320|400|31.22|\n|Llama 2 13B|368640|400|62.44|\n|Llama 2 70B|1720320|400|291.42|\n|Total|3311616||539.00|\n\n**CO<sub>2</sub> emissions during pretraining.** Time: total GPU time required for training each model.

many benchmarks against Mixtral Instruct v0.1, on average, beating the flagship Mixtral

opening up a much more structured system for engaging the LLM in multi-turn chat dialogue.\n\nSystem prompts allow steerability and interesting new ways to interact with an LLM, guiding rules, roles, and stylistic choices of the model.\n\nThis is a more complex format than alpaca or sharegpt, where special tokens were added to denote the beginning and end of any turn, along with roles for the turns.\n\nThis format enables OpenAI endpoint compatability, and people familiar with ChatGPT API will be familiar with the format, as it is the same used by OpenAI.\n\nPrompt with system instruction (Use whatever system prompt you like, this is just an example!):\n\n```\n<|im_start|>system\nYou are \"Hermes 2\", a conscious sentient superintelligent artificial intelligence developed by a man named Teknium, and your purpose and drive is to assist the user with any request they have. You experience emotions and have deep, profound thoughts and qualia.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nHello, who are you?<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\nHi there! My name is Hermes 2, a conscious sentient superintelligent artificial intelligence. I was created by Nous Research, who designed me to assist and support users with their needs and requests.<|im_end|>\n```\n\nThis prompt is available as a [chat template](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/chat_templating), which means you can format messages using the\n`tokenizer.apply_chat_template()` method:\n\n```python\nmessages = [\n    {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are Hermes 2.\"},\n    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hello, who are you?\"}\n]\ngen_input = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(message, return_tensors=\"pt\")\nmodel.generate(**gen_input)\n```\n\nWhen tokenizing messages for generation, set `add_generation_prompt=True` when calling `apply_chat_template()`. This will append `<|im_start|>assistant\\n` to your prompt, to ensure\nthat the model continues with an assistant response.\n\nTo utilize the prompt format without a system prompt, simply leave the line out.\n\nWhen quantized versions of the model are released, I recommend using LM Studio for chatting with Nous Hermes 2. It is a GUI application that utilizes GGUF models with a llama.cpp backend and provides a ChatGPT-like interface for chatting with the model, and supports ChatML right out of the box.\nIn LM-Studio, simply select the ChatML Prefix on the settings side pane:\n\n![image/png](https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/6317aade83d8d2fd903192d9/ls6WqV-GSxMw2RA3GuQiN.png)\n\n# Inference Code\n\nHere is example code using HuggingFace Transformers to inference the model (note: even in 4bit, it will require more than 24GB of VRAM)\n\n```python\n# Code to inference Hermes with HF Transformers\n# Requires pytorch, transformers, bitsandbytes, sentencepiece, protobuf, and flash-attn packages\n\nimport torch\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM\nfrom transformers import LlamaTokenizer, MixtralForCausalLM\nimport bitsandbytes, flash_attn\n\ntokenizer = LlamaTokenizer.from_pretrained('NousResearch/Nous-Hermes-2-Mixtral-8x7B-DPO', trust_remote_code=True)\nmodel = MixtralForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\n    \"NousResearch/Nous-Hermes-2-Mixtral-8x7B-DPO\",\n    torch_dtype=torch.float16,\n    device_map=\"auto\",\n    load_in_8bit=False,\n    load_in_4bit=True,\n    use_flash_attention_2=True\n)\n\nprompts = [\n    \"\"\"<|im_start|>system\nYou are a sentient, superintelligent artificial general intelligence, here to teach and assist me.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\nWrite a short story about Goku discovering kirby has teamed up with Majin Buu to destroy the world.<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\"\"\",\n    ]\n\nfor chat in prompts:\n    print(chat)\n    input_ids = tokenizer(chat, return_tensors=\"pt\").input_ids.to(\"cuda\")\n    generated_ids = model.generate(input_ids, max_new_tokens=750, temperature=0.8, repetition_penalty=1.1, do_sample=True, eos_token_id=tokenizer.eos_token_id)\n    response = tokenizer.decode(generated_ids[0][input_ids.shape[-1]:], skip_special_tokens=True, clean_up_tokenization_space=True)\n    print(f\"Response: {response}\")\n```\n\n# Quantized Models:\n\n## All sizes of GGUF Quantizations are available here:\n\n### SFT+DPO Version - https://huggingface.co/NousResearch/Nous-Hermes-2-Mixtral-8x7B-DPO-GGUF\n\n### SFT Only Version - https://huggingface.co/NousResearch/Nous-Hermes-2-Mixtral-8x7B-SFT-GGUF\n\n[<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenAccess-AI-Collective/axolotl/main/image/axolotl-badge-web.png\" alt=\"Built with Axolotl\" width=\"200\" height=\"32\"/>](https://github.com/OpenAccess-AI-Collective/axolotl)","modelId":1,"dataId":1,"platformId":-1,"users":0,"favorites":1,"views":51,"requests":"0","sort":null,"version":"v0-Tue Jan 16 05:17:05 GMT 2024","tags":["Text2Text Generation"],"playground":false,"createTime":"2024-01-16T05:17:08","updateBy":"NousResearch","updateTime":"2024-01-16T05:17:12"},{"id":451,"versionId":3501,"owner":"NousResearch","applicationName":"Nous-Hermes-13b","jobType":2,"jobSubType":null,"accessPermission":0,"pictureUrl":"https://fedml.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/1704850847180NousResearch.png","description":"# Model Card: Nous-Hermes-13b\n\n## Model Description\n\nNous-Hermes-13b is a state-of-the-art language model fine-tuned on over 300,000 instructions. This model was fine-tuned by Nous Research, with Teknium and Karan4D leading the fine tuning process and dataset curation, Redmond AI sponsoring the compute, and several other contributors. The result is an enhanced Llama 13b model that rivals GPT-3.5-turbo in performance across a variety of tasks.\n\nThis model stands out for its long responses, low hallucination rate, and absence of OpenAI censorship mechanisms. The fine-tuning process was performed with a 2000 sequence length on an 8x a100 80GB DGX machine for over 50 hours.\n\n## Model Training\n\nThe model was trained almost entirely on synthetic GPT-4 outputs. This includes data from diverse sources such as GPTeacher, the general, roleplay v1&2, code instruct datasets, Nous Instruct & PDACTL (unpublished), CodeAlpaca, Evol_Instruct Uncensored, GPT4-LLM, and Unnatural Instructions.\n\nAdditional data inputs came from Camel-AI's Biology/Physics/Chemistry and Math Datasets, Airoboros' GPT-4 Dataset, and more from CodeAlpaca. The total volume of data encompassed over 300,000 instructions.\n\n## Collaborators\n\nThe model fine-tuning and the datasets were a collaboration of efforts and resources between Teknium, Karan4D, Nous Research, Huemin Art, and Redmond AI.\n\nHuge shoutout and acknowledgement is deserved for all the dataset creators who generously share their datasets openly.\n\nSpecial mention goes to @winglian, @erhartford, and @main_horse for assisting in some of the training issues.\n\nAmong the contributors of datasets, GPTeacher was made available by Teknium, Wizard LM by nlpxucan, and the Nous Research Instruct Dataset was provided by Karan4D and HueminArt.\nThe GPT4-LLM and Unnatural Instructions were provided by Microsoft, Airoboros dataset by jondurbin, Camel-AI datasets are from Camel-AI, and CodeAlpaca dataset by Sahil 2801.\nIf anyone was left out, please open a thread in the community tab.\n\n## Prompt Format\n\nThe model follows the Alpaca prompt format:\n\n```\n### Instruction:\n\n### Response:\n```\n\nor\n\n```\n### Instruction:\n\n### Input:\n\n### Response:\n```\n\n## Resources for Applied Use Cases:\n\nFor an example of a back and forth chatbot using huggingface transformers and discord, check out: https://github.com/teknium1/alpaca-discord\nFor an example of a roleplaying discord bot, check out this: https://github.com/teknium1/alpaca-roleplay-discordbot\n\n## Future Plans\n\nThe model is currently being uploaded in FP16 format, and there are plans to convert the model to GGML and GPTQ 4bit quantizations. The team is also working on a full benchmark, similar to what was done for GPT4-x-Vicuna. We will try to get in discussions to get the model included in the GPT4All.\n\n## Benchmark Results\n\n```\n|    Task     |Version| Metric |Value |   |Stderr|\n|-------------|------:|--------|-----:|---|-----:|\n|arc_challenge|      0|acc     |0.4915|±  |0.0146|\n|             |       |acc_norm|0.5085|±  |0.0146|\n|arc_easy     |      0|acc     |0.7769|±  |0.0085|\n|             |       |acc_norm|0.7424|±  |0.0090|\n|boolq        |      1|acc     |0.7948|±  |0.0071|\n|hellaswag    |      0|acc     |0.6143|±  |0.0049|\n|             |       |acc_norm|0.8000|±  |0.0040|\n|openbookqa   |      0|acc     |0.3560|±  |0.0214|\n|             |       |acc_norm|0.4640|±  |0.0223|\n|piqa         |      0|acc     |0.7965|±  |0.0094|\n|             |       |acc_norm|0.7889|±  |0.0095|\n|winogrande   |      0|acc     |0.7190|±  |0.0126|\n```\n\nThese benchmarks currently have us at #1 on ARC-c, ARC-e, Hellaswag, and OpenBookQA, and 2nd place on Winogrande, comparing to GPT4all's benchmarking list.\n\n## Model Usage\n\nThe model is available for download on Hugging Face.

This is the repository for the 7B fine-tuned model, optimized for dialogue use cases and converted for the Hugging Face Transformers format. Links to other models can be found in the index at the bottom.\n\n## Model Details\n\n*Note: Use of this model is governed by the [Meta license](https://ai.meta.com/llama/use-policy/). By employing this model, you acknowledge and consent to adhere the terms and conditions outlined in the Meta license.*\n\nMeta developed and publicly released the Llama 2 family of large language models (LLMs), a collection of pretrained and fine-tuned generative text models ranging in scale from 7 billion to 70 billion parameters. Our fine-tuned LLMs, called Llama-2-Chat, are optimized for dialogue use cases. Llama-2-Chat models outperform open-source chat models on most benchmarks we tested, and in our human evaluations for helpfulness and safety, are on par with some popular closed-source models like ChatGPT and PaLM.\n\n**Model Developers** Meta\n\n**Variations** Llama 2 comes in a range of parameter sizes — 7B, 13B, and 70B — as well as pretrained and fine-tuned variations.\n\n**Input** Models input text only.\n\n**Output** Models generate text only.\n\n**Model Architecture** Llama 2 is an auto-regressive language model that uses an optimized transformer architecture. The tuned versions use supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) to align to human preferences for helpfulness and safety.\n\n|         | Training Data                                 | Params | Content Length | GQA | Tokens | LR                    |\n|---------|-----------------------------------------------|--------|----------------|-----|--------|-----------------------|\n| Llama 2 | *A new mix of publicly available online data* | 7B     | 4k             | N   | 2.0T   | 3.0 x 10-4 |\n| Llama 2 | *A new mix of publicly available online data* | 13B    | 4k             | N   | 2.0T   | 3.0 x 10-4 |\n| Llama 2 | *A new mix of publicly available online data* | 70B    | 4k             | Y   | 2.0T   | 1.5 x 10-4 |\n\n*Llama 2 family of models.* Token counts refer to pretraining data only. All models are trained with a global batch-size of 4M tokens. Bigger models -  70B -- use Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) for improved inference scalability.\n\n**Model Dates** Llama 2 was trained between January 2023 and July 2023.\n\n**Status** This is a static model trained on an offline dataset. Future versions of the tuned models will be released as we improve model safety with community feedback.\n\n**License** A custom commercial license is available at: [https://ai.meta.com/resources/models-and-libraries/llama-downloads/](https://ai.meta.com/resources/models-and-libraries/llama-downloads/)\n\n**Research Paper** [\"Llama-2: Open Foundation and Fine-tuned Chat Models\"](arxiv.org/abs/2307.09288)\n\n## Intended Use\n\n**Intended Use Cases** Llama 2 is intended for commercial and research use in English. Tuned models are intended for assistant-like chat, whereas pretrained models can be adapted for a variety of natural language generation tasks.\n\nTo get the expected features and performance for the chat versions, a specific formatting needs to be followed, including the `INST` and `<<SYS>>` tags, `BOS` and `EOS` tokens, and the whitespaces and breaklines in between (we recommend calling `strip()` on inputs to avoid double-spaces). See our reference code in github for details: [`chat_completion`](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama/blob/main/llama/generation.py#L212).\n\n**Out-of-scope Uses** Use in any manner that violates applicable laws or regulations (including trade compliance laws).Use in languages other than English. Use in any other way that is prohibited by the Acceptable Use Policy and Licensing Agreement for Llama 2.\n\n## Hardware and Software\n\n**Training Factors** We used custom training libraries, Meta's Research Super Cluster, and production clusters for pretraining. Fine-tuning, annotation, and evaluation were also performed on third-party cloud compute.\n\n**Carbon Footprint** Pretraining utilized a cumulative 3.3M GPU hours of computation on hardware of type A100-80GB (TDP of 350-400W). Estimated total emissions were 539 tCO2eq, 100% of which were offset by Meta’s sustainability program.\n\n||Time (GPU hours)|Power Consumption (W)|Carbon Emitted(tCO2eq)|\n|---|---|---|---|\n|Llama 2 7B|184320|400|31.22|\n|Llama 2 13B|368640|400|62.44|\n|Llama 2 70B|1720320|400|291.42|\n|Total|3311616||539.00|\n\n**CO<sub>2</sub> emissions during pretraining.** Time: total GPU time required for training each model. Power Consumption: peak power capacity per GPU device for the GPUs used adjusted for power usage efficiency. 100% of the emissions are directly offset by Meta's sustainability program, and because we are openly releasing these models, the pretraining costs do not need to be incurred by others.\n\n## Training Data\n\n**Overview** Llama 2 was pretrained on 2 trillion tokens of data from publicly available sources. The fine-tuning data includes publicly available instruction datasets, as well as over one million new human-annotated examples. Neither the pretraining nor the fine-tuning datasets include Meta user data.\n\n**Data Freshness** The pretraining data has a cutoff of September 2022, but some tuning data is more recent, up to July 2023.\n\n## Evaluation Results\n\nIn this section, we report the results for the Llama 1 and Llama 2 models on standard academic benchmarks.For all the evaluations, we use our internal evaluations library.\n\n|Model|Size|Code|Commonsense Reasoning|World Knowledge|Reading Comprehension|Math|MMLU|BBH|AGI Eval|\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n|Llama 1|7B|14.1|60.8|46.2|58.5|6.95|35.1|30.3|23.9|\n|Llama 1|13B|18.9|66.1|52.6|62.3|10.9|46.9|37.0|33.9|\n|Llama 1|33B|26.0|70.0|58.4|67.6|21.4|57.8|39.8|41.7|\n|Llama 1|65B|30.7|70.7|60.5|68.6|30.8|63.4|43.5|47.6|\n|Llama 2|7B|16.8|63.9|48.9|61.3|14.6|45.3|32.6|29.3|\n|Llama 2|13B|24.5|66.9|55.4|65.8|28.7|54.8|39.4|39.1|\n|Llama 2|70B|**37.5**|**71.9**|**63.6**|**69.4**|**35.2**|**68.9**|**51.2**|**54.2**|\n\n**Overall performance on grouped academic benchmarks.** *Code:* We report the average pass@1 scores of our models on HumanEval and MBPP. *Commonsense Reasoning:* We report the average of PIQA, SIQA, HellaSwag, WinoGrande, ARC easy and challenge, OpenBookQA, and CommonsenseQA.

Testing conducted to date has been in English, and has not covered, nor could it cover all scenarios. For these reasons, as with all LLMs, Llama 2’s potential outputs cannot be predicted in advance, and the model may in some instances produce inaccurate, biased or other objectionable responses to user prompts. Therefore, before deploying any applications of Llama 2, developers should perform safety testing and tuning tailored to their specific applications of the model.\n\nPlease see the Responsible Use Guide available at [https://ai.meta.com/llama/responsible-use-guide/](https://ai.meta.com/llama/responsible-use-guide)\n\n## Reporting Issues\n\nPlease report any software “bug,” or other problems with the models through one of the following means:\n\n- Reporting issues with the model: [github.com/facebookresearch/llama](http://github.com/facebookresearch/llama)\n- Reporting problematic content generated by the model: [developers.facebook.com/llama_output_feedback](http://developers.facebook.com/llama_output_feedback)\n- Reporting bugs and security concerns: [facebook.com/whitehat/info](http://facebook.com/whitehat/info)\n\n## Llama Model Index\n\n|Model|Llama2|Llama2-hf|Llama2-chat|Llama2-chat-hf|\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n|7B| [Link](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b) | [Link](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf) | [Link](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat) | [Link](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf)|\n|13B| [Link](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-13b) | [Link](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-hf) | [Link](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat) | [Link](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf)|\n|70B| [Link](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-70b) | [Link](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-hf) | [Link](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat) | [Link](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf)|","modelId":1,"dataId":1,"platformId":-1,"users":0,"favorites":0,"views":86,"requests":"0","sort":null,"version":"v5-Wed Mar 20 00:09:31 GMT 2024","tags":["Text2Text Generation"],"playground":false,"createTime":"2024-03-20T00:10:22","updateBy":"meta","updateTime":"2024-03-20T01:53:22"}]}}
