When prompted with code-switched text, Bark will attempt to employ the native accent for the respective languages. English quality is best for the time being, and we expect other languages to further improve with scaling. \n<br>\n<br>\n\n```python\ntext_prompt = \"\"\"\n    추석은 내가 가장 좋아하는 명절이다. 나는 며칠 동안 휴식을 취하고 친구 및 가족과 시간을 보낼 수 있습니다.\n\"\"\"\naudio_array = generate_audio(text_prompt)\n```\n\n[suno_korean.webm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32879321/235313033-dc4477b9-2da0-4b94-9c8b-a8c2d8f5bb5e.webm)\n\n*Note: since Bark recognizes languages automatically from input text, it is possible to use, for example, a german history prompt with english text. This usually leads to english audio with a german accent.*\n\n```python\ntext_prompt = \"\"\"\n    Der Dreißigjährige Krieg (1618-1648) war ein verheerender Konflikt, der Europa stark geprägt hat.\n    This is a beginning of the history.

The community also often shares presets in [Discord](https://discord.gg/J2B2vsjKuE).\n\n> Bark tries to match the tone, pitch, emotion and prosody of a given preset, but does not currently support custom voice cloning. The model also attempts to preserve music, ambient noise, etc.\n\n```python\ntext_prompt = \"\"\"\n    I have a silky smooth voice, and today I will tell you about \n    the exercise regimen of the common sloth.\n\"\"\"\naudio_array = generate_audio(text_prompt, history_prompt=\"v2/en_speaker_1\")\n```\n\n[sloth.webm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5068315/230684883-a344c619-a560-4ff5-8b99-b4463a34487b.webm)\n\n</details>\n\n### \uD83D\uDCC3 Generating Longer Audio\n\nBy default, `generate_audio` works well with around 13 seconds of spoken text.

Steps to get started:\n\n1. First install the \uD83E\uDD17 [Transformers library](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) from main:\n\n```\npip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.git\n```\n\n2. Run the following Python code to generate speech samples:\n\n```py\nfrom transformers import AutoProcessor, BarkModel\n\nprocessor = AutoProcessor.from_pretrained(\"suno/bark\")\nmodel = BarkModel.from_pretrained(\"suno/bark\")\n\nvoice_preset = \"v2/en_speaker_6\"\n\ninputs = processor(\"Hello, my dog is cute\", voice_preset=voice_preset)\n\naudio_array = model.generate(**inputs)\naudio_array = audio_array.cpu().numpy().squeeze()\n```\n\n3. Listen to the audio samples either in an ipynb notebook:\n\n```py\nfrom IPython.display import Audio\n\nsample_rate = model.generation_config.sample_rate\nAudio(audio_array, rate=sample_rate)\n```\n\nOr save them as a `.wav` file using a third-party library, e.g. `scipy`:\n\n```py\nimport scipy\n\nsample_rate = model.generation_config.sample_rate\nscipy.io.wavfile.write(\"bark_out.wav\", rate=sample_rate, data=audio_array)\n```\n\nFor more details on using the Bark model for inference using the \uD83E\uDD17 Transformers library, refer to the\n[Bark docs](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/bark) or the hands-on\n[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1dWWkZzvu7L9Bunq9zvD-W02RFUXoW-Pd?usp=sharing).\n\n## \uD83D\uDEE0️ Hardware and Inference Speed\n\nBark has been tested and works on both CPU and GPU (`pytorch 2.0+`, CUDA 11.7 and CUDA 12.0).\n\nOn enterprise GPUs and PyTorch nightly, Bark can generate audio in roughly real-time. On older GPUs, default colab, or CPU, inference time might be significantly slower. For older GPUs or CPU you might want to consider using smaller models. Details can be found in out tutorial sections here.\n\nThe full version of Bark requires around 12GB of VRAM to hold everything on GPU at the same time.\nTo use a smaller version of the models, which should fit into 8GB VRAM, set the environment flag `SUNO_USE_SMALL_MODELS=True`.\n\nIf you don't have hardware available or if you want to play with bigger versions of our models, you can also sign up for early access to our model playground [here](https://suno-ai.typeform.com/suno-studio).\n\n## ⚙️ Details\n\nBark is fully generative text-to-audio model devolved for research and demo purposes. It follows a GPT style architecture similar to [AudioLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03143) and [Vall-E](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02111) and a quantized Audio representation from [EnCodec](https://github.com/facebookresearch/encodec). It is not a conventional TTS model, but instead a fully generative text-to-audio model capable of deviating in unexpected ways from any given script. Different to previous approaches, the input text prompt is converted directly to audio without the intermediate use of phonemes. It can therefore generalize to arbitrary instructions beyond speech such as music lyrics, sound effects or other non-speech sounds.\n\nBelow is a list of some known non-speech sounds, but we are finding more every day.

You can see find more info [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/package_reference/environment_variables#hfhome).\n\n#### Bark's generations sometimes differ from my prompts. What's happening?\n\n* Bark is a GPT-style model. As such, it may take some creative liberties in its generations, resulting in higher-variance model outputs than traditional text-to-speech approaches.\n\n#### What voices are supported by Bark?\n\n* Bark supports 100+ speaker presets across [supported languages](#supported-languages). You can browse the library of speaker presets [here](https://suno-ai.notion.site/8b8e8749ed514b0cbf3f699013548683?v=bc67cff786b04b50b3ceb756fd05f68c). The community also shares presets in [Discord](https://suno.ai/discord). Bark also supports generating unique random voices that fit the input text. Bark does not currently support custom voice cloning.\n\n#### Why is the output limited to ~13-14 seconds?\n\n* Bark is a GPT-style model, and its architecture/context window is optimized to output generations with roughly this length.\n\n#### How much VRAM do I need?\n\n* The full version of Bark requires around 12Gb of memory to hold everything on GPU at the same time. However, even smaller cards down to ~2Gb work with some additional settings. Simply add the following code snippet before your generation:\n\n```python\nimport os\nos.environ[\"SUNO_OFFLOAD_CPU\"] = \"True\"\nos.environ[\"SUNO_USE_SMALL_MODELS\"] = \"True\"\n```\n\n#### My generated audio sounds like a 1980s phone call. What's happening?\n\n* Bark generates audio from scratch. It is not meant to create only high-fidelity, studio-quality speech. Rather, outputs could be anything from perfect speech to multiple people arguing at a baseball game recorded with bad microphones.\n\n[//]: br","modelId":1,"dataId":1,"platformId":-1,"users":0,"favorites":2,"views":220,"requests":"0","sort":null,"version":"v7-Tue Apr 09 22:17:35 GMT 2024","tags":["Text to Audio"],"playground":false,"createTime":"2024-04-09T22:17:54","updateBy":"suno","updateTime":"2024-04-09T22:23:53"},{"id":980,"versionId":4701,"owner":"deepseek-ai","applicationName":"deepseek-coder-6-7b-instruct","jobType":2,"jobSubType":null,"accessPermission":0,"pictureUrl":"https://fedml.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/1711747895103Uk1zNOj4_400x400.jpg","description":"### 1.

Future versions of Code Llama - Instruct will be released as we improve model safety with community feedback.\n\n**License** A custom commercial license is available at: [https://ai.meta.com/resources/models-and-libraries/llama-downloads/](https://ai.meta.com/resources/models-and-libraries/llama-downloads/)\n\n**Research Paper** More information can be found in the paper \"[Code Llama: Open Foundation Models for Code](https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/code-llama-open-foundation-models-for-code/)\" or its [arXiv page](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12950).\n\n## Intended Use\n\n**Intended Use Cases** Code Llama and its variants is intended for commercial and research use in English and relevant programming languages. The base model Code Llama can be adapted for a variety of code synthesis and understanding tasks, Code Llama - Python is designed specifically to handle the Python programming language, and Code Llama - Instruct is intended to be safer to use for code assistant and generation applications.\n\n**Out-of-Scope Uses** Use in any manner that violates applicable laws or regulations (including trade compliance laws). Use in languages other than English. Use in any other way that is prohibited by the Acceptable Use Policy and Licensing Agreement for Code Llama and its variants.\n\n## Hardware and Software\n\n**Training Factors** We used custom training libraries. The training and fine-tuning of the released models have been performed Meta’s Research Super Cluster.\n\n**Carbon Footprint** In aggregate, training all 9 Code Llama models required 400K GPU hours of computation on hardware of type A100-80GB (TDP of 350-400W). Estimated total emissions were 65.3 tCO2eq, 100% of which were offset by Meta’s sustainability program.\n\n## Training Data\n\nAll experiments reported here and the released models have been trained and fine-tuned using the same data as Llama 2 with different weights (see Section 2 and Table 1 in the [research paper](https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/code-llama-open-foundation-models-for-code/) for details).\n\n## Evaluation Results\n\nSee evaluations for the main models and detailed ablations in Section 3 and safety evaluations in Section 4 of the research paper.\n\n## Ethical Considerations and Limitations\n\nCode Llama and its variants are a new technology that carries risks with use. Testing conducted to date has been in English, and has not covered, nor could it cover all scenarios. For these reasons, as with all LLMs, Code Llama’s potential outputs cannot be predicted in advance, and the model may in some instances produce inaccurate or objectionable responses to user prompts. Therefore, before deploying any applications of Code Llama, developers should perform safety testing and tuning tailored to their specific applications of the model.\n\nPlease see the Responsible Use Guide available available at [https://ai.meta.com/llama/responsible-use-guide](https://ai.meta.com/llama/responsible-use-guide).","modelId":1,"dataId":1,"platformId":-1,"users":0,"favorites":0,"views":56,"requests":"0","sort":null,"version":"v0-Wed Jan 10 07:41:03 GMT 2024","tags":["Code Generation"],"playground":false,"createTime":"2024-01-10T07:41:56","updateBy":"meta","updateTime":"2024-01-10T07:42:40"},{"id":468,"versionId":3526,"owner":"meta","applicationName":"CodeLlama-34b-Instruct","jobType":2,"jobSubType":null,"accessPermission":0,"pictureUrl":"https://fedml.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/1704872479897CodeLlama.webp","description":"# **Code Llama**\n\nCode Llama is a collection of pretrained and fine-tuned generative text models ranging in scale from 7 billion to 34 billion parameters.
