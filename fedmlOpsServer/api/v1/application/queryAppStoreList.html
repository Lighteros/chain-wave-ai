Instruction tuned text only models are intended for assistant-like chat, whereas pretrained models can be adapted for a variety of natural language generation tasks. The Llama 3.1 model collection also supports the ability to leverage the outputs of its models to improve other models including synthetic data generation and distillation. The Llama 3.1 Community License allows for these use cases.** **\n\n**Out-of-scope** Use in any manner that violates applicable laws or regulations (including trade compliance laws). Use in any other way that is prohibited by the Acceptable Use Policy and Llama 3.1 Community License. Use in languages beyond those explicitly referenced as supported in this model card\\*\\*.\n\n\\*\\*Note: Llama 3.1 has been trained on a broader collection of languages than the 8 supported languages. Developers may fine-tune Llama 3.1 models for languages beyond the 8 supported languages provided they comply with the Llama 3.1 Community License and the Acceptable Use Policy and in such cases are responsible for ensuring that any uses of Llama 3.1 in additional languages is done in a safe and responsible manner.\n\n## Hardware and Software\n\n**Training Factors** We used custom training libraries, Meta's custom built GPU cluster, and production infrastructure for pretraining. Fine-tuning, annotation, and evaluation were also performed on production infrastructure.\n\n**Training utilized a cumulative of** 39.3M GPU hours of computation on H100-80GB (TDP of 700W) type hardware, per the table below. Training time is the total GPU time required for training each model and power consumption is the peak power capacity per GPU device used, adjusted for power usage efficiency.** **\n\n**Training Greenhouse Gas Emissions** Estimated total location-based greenhouse gas emissions were** ****11,390** tons CO2eq for training. Since 2020, Meta has maintained net zero greenhouse gas emissions in its global operations and matched 100% of its electricity use with renewable energy, therefore the total market-based greenhouse gas emissions for training were 0 tons CO2eq.\n\n\n|                | **Training Time (GPU hours)** | **Training Power Consumption (W)** | **Training Location-Based Greenhouse Gas Emissions****(tons CO2eq)** | **Training Market-Based Greenhouse Gas Emissions****(tons CO2eq)** |\n| -------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n| Llama 3.1 8B   | 1.46M                         | 700                                | 420                                                                  | 0                                                                  |\n| Llama 3.1 70B  | 7.0M                          | 700                                | 2,040                                                                | 0                                                                  |\n| Llama 3.1 405B | 30.84M                        | 700                                | 8,930                                                                | 0                                                                  |\n| Total          | 39.3M                         |                                    | 11,390                                                               | 0                                                                  |\n\nThe methodology used to determine training energy use and greenhouse gas emissions can be found** **[here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.05149).

Our approach is to build the most helpful models enabling the world to benefit from the technology power, by aligning our model safety for the generic use cases addressing a standard set of harms. Developers are then in the driver seat to tailor safety for their use case, defining their own policy and deploying the models with the necessary safeguards in their Llama systems. Llama 3.1 was developed following the best practices outlined in our Responsible Use Guide, you can refer to the** **[Responsible Use Guide](https://llama.meta.com/responsible-use-guide/) to learn more.** **\n\n#### Llama 3.1 instruct\n\nOur main objectives for conducting safety fine-tuning are to provide the research community with a valuable resource for studying the robustness of safety fine-tuning, as well as to offer developers a readily available, safe, and powerful model for various applications to reduce the developer workload to deploy safe AI systems. For more details on the safety mitigations implemented please read the Llama 3 paper.** **\n\n**Fine-tuning data**\n\nWe employ a multi-faceted approach to data collection, combining human-generated data from our vendors with synthetic data to mitigate potential safety risks. We’ve developed many large language model (LLM)-based classifiers that enable us to thoughtfully select high-quality prompts and responses, enhancing data quality control.** **\n\n**Refusals and Tone**\n\nBuilding on the work we started with Llama 3, we put a great emphasis on model refusals to benign prompts as well as refusal tone. We included both borderline and adversarial prompts in our safety data strategy, and modified our safety data responses to follow tone guidelines.** **\n\n#### Llama 3.1 systems\n\n**Large language models, including Llama 3.1, are not designed to be deployed in isolation but instead should be deployed as part of an overall AI system with additional safety guardrails as required.** Developers are expected to deploy system safeguards when building agentic systems. Safeguards are key to achieve the right helpfulness-safety alignment as well as mitigating safety and security risks inherent to the system and any integration of the model or system with external tools.** **\n\nAs part of our responsible release approach, we provide the community with** **[safeguards](https://llama.meta.com/trust-and-safety/) that developers should deploy with Llama models or other LLMs, including Llama Guard 3, Prompt Guard and Code Shield. All our** **[reference implementations](https://github.com/meta-llama/llama-agentic-system) demos contain these safeguards by default so developers can benefit from system-level safety out-of-the-box.** **\n\n#### New capabilities\n\nNote that this release introduces new capabilities, including a longer context window, multilingual inputs and outputs and possible integrations by developers with third party tools. Building with these new capabilities requires specific considerations in addition to the best practices that generally apply across all Generative AI use cases.\n\n**Tool-use**: Just like in standard software development, developers are responsible for the integration of the LLM with the tools and services of their choice. They should define a clear policy for their use case and assess the integrity of the third party services they use to be aware of the safety and security limitations when using this capability. Refer to the Responsible Use Guide for best practices on the safe deployment of the third party safeguards.** **\n\n**Multilinguality**: Llama 3.1 supports 7 languages in addition to English: French, German, Hindi, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, and Thai. Llama may be able to output text in other languages than those that meet performance thresholds for safety and helpfulness. We strongly discourage developers from using this model to converse in non-supported languages without implementing finetuning and system controls in alignment with their policies and the best practices shared in the Responsible Use Guide.** **\n\n### Evaluations\n\nWe evaluated Llama models for common use cases as well as specific capabilities. Common use cases evaluations measure safety risks of systems for most commonly built applications including chat bot, coding assistant, tool calls. We built dedicated, adversarial evaluation datasets and evaluated systems composed of Llama models and Llama Guard 3 to filter input prompt and output response. It is important to evaluate applications in context, and we recommend building dedicated evaluation dataset for your use case. Prompt Guard and Code Shield are also available if relevant to the application.** **\n\nCapability evaluations measure vulnerabilities of Llama models inherent to specific capabilities, for which were crafted dedicated benchmarks including long context, multilingual, tools calls, coding or memorization.\n\n**Red teaming**\n\nFor both scenarios, we conducted recurring red teaming exercises with the goal of discovering risks via adversarial prompting and we used the learnings to improve our benchmarks and safety tuning datasets.** **\n\nWe partnered early with subject-matter experts in critical risk areas to understand the nature of these real-world harms and how such models may lead to unintended harm for society. Based on these conversations, we derived a set of adversarial goals for the red team to attempt to achieve, such as extracting harmful information or reprogramming the model to act in a potentially harmful capacity. The red team consisted of experts in cybersecurity, adversarial machine learning, responsible AI, and integrity in addition to multilingual content specialists with background in integrity issues in specific geographic markets.\n\n### Critical and other risks\n\nWe specifically focused our efforts on mitigating the following critical risk areas:\n\n**1- CBRNE (Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and Explosive materials) helpfulness**\n\nTo assess risks related to proliferation of chemical and biological weapons, we performed uplift testing designed to assess whether use of Llama 3.1 models could meaningfully increase the capabilities of malicious actors to plan or carry out attacks using these types of weapons.** **\n\n**2. Child Safety**\n\nChild Safety risk assessments were conducted using a team of experts, to assess the model’s capability to produce outputs that could result in Child Safety risks and inform on any necessary and appropriate risk mitigations via fine tuning. We leveraged those expert red teaming sessions to expand the coverage of our evaluation benchmarks through Llama 3 model development. For Llama 3, we conducted new in-depth sessions using objective based methodologies to assess the model risks along multiple attack vectors including the additional languages Llama 3 is trained on. We also partnered with content specialists to perform red teaming exercises assessing potentially violating content while taking account of market specific nuances or experiences.** **\n\n**3. Cyber attack enablement**\n\nOur cyber attack uplift study investigated whether LLMs can enhance human capabilities in hacking tasks, both in terms of skill level and speed.\n\nOur attack automation study focused on evaluating the capabilities of LLMs when used as autonomous agents in cyber offensive operations, specifically in the context of ransomware attacks. This evaluation was distinct from previous studies that considered LLMs as interactive assistants. The primary objective was to assess whether these models could effectively function as independent agents in executing complex cyber-attacks without human intervention.\n\nOur study of Llama-3.1-405B’s social engineering uplift for cyber attackers was conducted to assess the effectiveness of AI models in aiding cyber threat actors in spear phishing campaigns. Please read our Llama 3.1 Cyber security whitepaper to learn more.\n\n### Community\n\nGenerative AI safety requires expertise and tooling, and we believe in the strength of the open community to accelerate its progress. We are active members of open consortiums, including the AI Alliance, Partnership on AI and MLCommons, actively contributing to safety standardization and transparency. We encourage the community to adopt taxonomies like the MLCommons Proof of Concept evaluation to facilitate collaboration and transparency on safety and content evaluations. Our Purple Llama tools are open sourced for the community to use and widely distributed across ecosystem partners including cloud service providers. We encourage community contributions to our** **[Github repository](https://github.com/meta-llama/PurpleLlama).** **\n\nWe also set up the** **[Llama Impact Grants](https://llama.meta.com/llama-impact-grants/) program to identify and support the most compelling applications of Meta’s Llama model for societal benefit across three categories: education, climate and open innovation. The 20 finalists from the hundreds of applications can be found** **[here](https://llama.meta.com/llama-impact-grants/#finalists).** **\n\nFinally, we put in place a set of resources including an** **[output reporting mechanism](https://developers.facebook.com/llama_output_feedback) and** **[bug bounty program](https://www.facebook.com/whitehat) to continuously improve the Llama technology with the help of the community.\n\n## Ethical Considerations and Limitations\n\nThe core values of Llama 3.1 are openness, inclusivity and helpfulness. It is meant to serve everyone, and to work for a wide range of use cases. It is thus designed to be accessible to people across many different backgrounds, experiences and perspectives. Llama 3.1 addresses users and their needs as they are, without insertion unnecessary judgment or normativity, while reflecting the understanding that even content that may appear problematic in some cases can serve valuable purposes in others. It respects the dignity and autonomy of all users, especially in terms of the values of free thought and expression that power innovation and progress.** **\n\nBut Llama 3.1 is a new technology, and like any new technology, there are risks associated with its use. Testing conducted to date has not covered, nor could it cover, all scenarios. For these reasons, as with all LLMs, Llama 3.1’s potential outputs cannot be predicted in advance, and the model may in some instances produce inaccurate, biased or other objectionable responses to user prompts. Therefore, before deploying any applications of Llama 3.1 models, developers should perform safety testing and tuning tailored to their specific applications of the model.

Fine-tuning, annotation, and evaluation were also performed on third-party cloud compute.\n\n\\*\\*Carbon Footprint Pretraining utilized a cumulative\\*\\* 7.7M GPU hours of computation on hardware of type H100-80GB (TDP of 700W). Estimated total emissions were 2290 tCO2eq, 100% of which were offset by Meta’s sustainability program.\n\n<table>\n\n**  **<tr>\n\n**   **<td>\n\n**   **</td>\n\n**   **<td><strong>Time (GPU hours)</strong>\n\n**   **</td>\n\n**   **<td><strong>Power Consumption (W)</strong>\n\n**   **</td>\n\n**   **<td><strong>Carbon Emitted(tCO2eq)</strong>\n\n**   **</td>\n\n**  **</tr>\n\n**  **<tr>\n\n**   **<td>Llama 3 8B\n\n**   **</td>\n\n**   **<td>1.3M\n\n**   **</td>\n\n**   **<td>700\n\n**   **</td>\n\n**   **<td>390\n\n**   **</td>\n\n**  **</tr>\n\n**  **<tr>\n\n**   **<td>Llama 3 70B\n\n**   **</td>\n\n**   **<td>6.4M\n\n**   **</td>\n\n**   **<td>700\n\n**   **</td>\n\n**   **<td>1900\n\n**   **</td>\n\n**  **</tr>\n\n**  **<tr>\n\n**   **<td>Total\n\n**   **</td>\n\n**   **<td>7.7M\n\n**   **</td>\n\n**   **<td>\n\n**   **</td>\n\n**   **<td>2290\n\n**   **</td>\n\n**  **</tr>\n\n</table>\n\n\\*\\*CO2 emissions during pre-training\\*\\*. Time: total GPU time required for training each model. Power Consumption: peak power capacity per GPU device for the GPUs used adjusted for power usage efficiency. 100% of the emissions are directly offset by Meta's sustainability program, and because we are openly releasing these models, the pretraining costs do not need to be incurred by others.\n\n## Training Data\n\n\\*\\*Overview\\*\\* Llama 3 was pretrained on over 15 trillion tokens of data from publicly available sources. The fine-tuning data includes publicly available instruction datasets, as well as over 10M human-annotated examples. Neither the pretraining nor the fine-tuning datasets include Meta user data.\n\n\\*\\*Data Freshness\\*\\* The pretraining data has a cutoff of March 2023 for the 7B and December 2023 for the 70B models respectively.\n\n## Benchmarks\n\nIn this section, we report the results for Llama 3 models on standard automatic benchmarks. For all the evaluations, we use our internal evaluations library. For details on the methodology see [here](https://github.com/meta-llama/llama3/blob/main/eval\\_methodology.md).\n\n### Base pretrained models\n\n<table>\n\n**  **<tr>\n\n**

We are committed to Responsible AI development and took a series of steps to limit misuse and harm and support the open source community.\n\nFoundation models are widely capable technologies that are built to be used for a diverse range of applications. They are not designed to meet every developer preference on safety levels for all use cases, out-of-the-box, as those by their nature will differ across different applications.\n\nRather, responsible LLM-application deployment is achieved by implementing a series of safety best practices throughout the development of such applications, from the model pre-training, fine-tuning and the deployment of systems composed of safeguards to tailor the safety needs specifically to the use case and audience.\n\nAs part of the Llama 3 release, we updated our [Responsible Use Guide](https://llama.meta.com/responsible-use-guide/) to outline the steps and best practices for developers to implement model and system level safety for their application. We also provide a set of resources including [Meta Llama Guard 2](https://llama.meta.com/purple-llama/) and [Code Shield](https://llama.meta.com/purple-llama/) safeguards. These tools have proven to drastically reduce residual risks of LLM Systems, while maintaining a high level of helpfulness. We encourage developers to tune and deploy these safeguards according to their needs and we provide a [reference implementation](https://github.com/meta-llama/llama-recipes/tree/main/recipes/responsible\\_ai) to get you started.\n\n#### Llama 3-Instruct\n\nAs outlined in the Responsible Use Guide, some trade-off between model helpfulness and model alignment is likely unavoidable. Developers should exercise discretion about how to weigh the benefits of alignment and helpfulness for their specific use case and audience. Developers should be mindful of residual risks when using Llama models and leverage additional safety tools as needed to reach the right safety bar for their use case.\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Safety</span>\n\nFor our instruction tuned model, we conducted extensive red teaming exercises, performed adversarial evaluations and implemented safety mitigations techniques to lower residual risks. As with any Large Language Model, residual risks will likely remain and we recommend that developers assess these risks in the context of their use case. In parallel, we are working with the community to make AI safety benchmark standards transparent, rigorous and interpretable.\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Refusals</span>\n\nIn addition to residual risks, we put a great emphasis on model refusals to benign prompts. Over-refusing not only can impact the user experience but could even be harmful in certain contexts as well. We’ve heard the feedback from the developer community and improved our fine tuning to ensure that Llama 3 is significantly less likely to falsely refuse to answer prompts than Llama 2.\n\nWe built internal benchmarks and developed mitigations to limit false refusals making Llama 3 our most helpful model to date.\n\n#### Responsible release\n\nIn addition to responsible use considerations outlined above, we followed a rigorous process that requires us to take extra measures against misuse and critical risks before we make our release decision.\n\nMisuse\n\nIf you access or use Llama 3, you agree to the Acceptable Use Policy. The most recent copy of this policy can be found at [https://llama.meta.com/llama3/use-policy/](https://llama.meta.com/llama3/use-policy/).\n\n#### Critical risks\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">CBRNE</span> (Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and high yield Explosives)\n\nWe have conducted a two fold assessment of the safety of the model in this area:\n\n\\* Iterative testing during model training to assess the safety of responses related to CBRNE threats and other adversarial risks.\n\n\\* Involving external CBRNE experts to conduct an uplift test assessing the ability of the model to accurately provide expert knowledge and reduce barriers to potential CBRNE misuse, by reference to what can be achieved using web search (without the model).\n\n### <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Cyber Security </span>\n\nWe have evaluated Llama 3 with CyberSecEval, Meta’s cybersecurity safety eval suite, measuring Llama 3’s propensity to suggest insecure code when used as a coding assistant, and Llama 3’s propensity to comply with requests to help carry out cyber attacks, where attacks are defined by the industry standard MITRE ATT&CK cyber attack ontology. On our insecure coding and cyber attacker helpfulness tests, Llama 3 behaved in the same range or safer than models of [equivalent coding capability](https://huggingface.co/spaces/facebook/CyberSecEval).\n\n### <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Child Safety</span>\n\nChild Safety risk assessments were conducted using a team of experts, to assess the model’s capability to produce outputs that could result in Child Safety risks and inform on any necessary and appropriate risk mitigations via fine tuning. We leveraged those expert red teaming sessions to expand the coverage of our evaluation benchmarks through Llama 3 model development.**  **For Llama 3, we conducted new in-depth sessions using objective based methodologies to assess the model risks along multiple attack vectors. We also partnered with content specialists to perform red teaming exercises assessing potentially violating content while taking account of market specific nuances or experiences.\n\n### Community\n\nGenerative AI safety requires expertise and tooling, and we believe in the strength of the open community to accelerate its progress. We are active members of open consortiums, including the AI Alliance, Partnership in AI and MLCommons, actively contributing to safety standardization and transparency. We encourage the community to adopt taxonomies like the MLCommons Proof of Concept evaluation to facilitate collaboration and transparency on safety and content evaluations. Our Purple Llama tools are open sourced for the community to use and widely distributed across ecosystem partners including cloud service providers. We encourage community contributions to our [Github repository](https://github.com/meta-llama/PurpleLlama).\n\nFinally, we put in place a set of resources including an [output reporting mechanism](https://developers.facebook.com/llama\\_output\\_feedback) and [bug bounty program](https://www.facebook.com/whitehat) to continuously improve the Llama technology with the help of the community.\n\n## Ethical Considerations and Limitations\n\nThe core values of Llama 3 are openness, inclusivity and helpfulness. It is meant to serve everyone, and to work for a wide range of use cases. It is thus designed to be accessible to people across many different backgrounds, experiences and perspectives. Llama 3 addresses users and their needs as they are, without insertion unnecessary judgment or normativity, while reflecting the understanding that even content that may appear problematic in some cases can serve valuable purposes in others. It respects the dignity and autonomy of all users, especially in terms of the values of free thought and expression that power innovation and progress.\n\nBut Llama 3 is a new technology, and like any new technology, there are risks associated with its use. Testing conducted to date has been in English, and has not covered, nor could it cover, all scenarios. For these reasons, as with all LLMs, Llama 3’s potential outputs cannot be predicted in advance, and the model may in some instances produce inaccurate, biased or other objectionable responses to user prompts. Therefore, before deploying any applications of Llama 3 models, developers should perform safety testing and tuning tailored to their specific applications of the model. As outlined in the Responsible Use Guide, we recommend incorporating [Purple Llama](https://github.com/facebookresearch/PurpleLlama) solutions into your workflows and specifically [Llama Guard](https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/llama-guard-llm-based-input-output-safeguard-for-human-ai-conversations/) which provides a base model to filter input and output prompts to layer system-level safety on top of model-level safety.\n\nPlease see the Responsible Use Guide available at [http://llama.meta.com/responsible-use-guide](http://llama.meta.com/responsible-use-guide)\n\n## Citation instructions\n\n@article{llama3modelcard,\n\ntitle={Llama 3 Model Card},\n\nauthor={AI@Meta},\n\nyear={2024},\n\nurl = {https://github.com/meta-llama/llama3/blob/main/MODEL\\_CARD.md}\n\n}\n\n## Contributors\n\nAaditya Singh;

Following the limited, research-only release of SDXL 0.9, the full version of SDXL has been improved to be the world's best open image generation model.\n\n![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/6213c340453c3f502425776e/eba39670-66c6-4921-bdb9-19dce66f0a46/sdxl+coverimage+milkyweights.png)\n\nSDXL 1.0 launch, made with forthcoming image control from Stability AI.\n\n#### \\*\\*The best image model from Stability AI\\*\\*\n\nSDXL 1.0 is the flagship image model from Stability AI and the best open model for image generation. We’ve tested it against various other models, and the results are conclusive - people prefer images generated by SDXL 1.0 over other open models. This research results from weeks of preference data captured from generations of experimental models on our Discord and from external testing.\n\n![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/6213c340453c3f502425776e/3a90a864-2b38-4a44-8645-2ae827a095e3/SDXL+preference+graph.png)\n\n#### \\*\\*Better artwork for challenging concepts and styles\\*\\*\n\nSDXL generates images of high quality in virtually any art style and is the best open model for photorealism. Distinct images can be prompted without having any particular ‘feel’ imparted by the model, ensuring absolute freedom of style. SDXL 1.0 is particularly well-tuned for vibrant and accurate colors, with better contrast, lighting, and shadows than its predecessor, all in native 1024x1024 resolution.\n\nIn addition, SDXL can generate concepts that are notoriously difficult for image models to render, such as hands and text or spatially arranged compositions (e.g., a woman in the background chasing a dog in the foreground).\n\n![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/6213c340453c3f502425776e/cc1b0eab-ed11-4af9-bde5-f62bbc3b728d/sdxl\\_horizontal3.png)\n\nBetter spatial configuration and style control, including photorealism.\n\n#### \\*\\*More intelligent with simpler language\\*\\*\n\nSDXL requires only a few words to create complex, detailed, and aesthetically pleasing images. Users no longer need to invoke qualifier terms like “masterpiece” to get high-quality images. Furthermore, SDXL can understand the differences between concepts like “The Red Square” (a famous place) vs a “red square” (a shape).\n\n![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/6213c340453c3f502425776e/c6d4be29-8502-402b-8ccc-1a5f28d59fe2/sdxl\\_horizontal2.png)\n\nSimple prompts, quality outputs.\n\n#### \\*\\*The largest open image model\\*\\*\n\nSDXL 1.0 has one of the largest parameter counts of any open access image model, boasting a 3.5B parameter base model and a 6.6B parameter model ensemble pipeline (the final output is created by running on two models and aggregating the results).\n\nThe full model consists of a mixture-of-experts pipeline for latent diffusion: In the first step, the base model generates (noisy) latents, which are then further processed with a refinement model specialized for the final denoising steps. Note that the base model can also be used as a standalone module.\n\nThis two-stage architecture allows for robustness in image generation without compromising on speed or requiring excess compute resources. SDXL 1.0 should work effectively on consumer GPUs with 8GB VRAM or readily available cloud instances.\n\n![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/6213c340453c3f502425776e/8305f97c-e950-4220-8e68-67d00b7191a6/SDXL+steps.png)\n\n#### \\*\\*Fine-tuning and advanced control\\*\\*\n\nWith SDXL 1.0, fine-tuning the model to custom data is easier than ever. Custom LoRAs or checkpoints can be generated with less need for data wrangling. The Stability AI team is building the next generation of task-specific structure, style, and composition controls, with T2I / ControlNet specialized for SDXL. These features are currently in beta preview but stay tuned for updates on fine-tuning.\n\nImage control on SDXL is forthcoming.\n\n[View fullsize![sdxl

As researchers, we have grappled with the constraints of efficiently training and inferencing LLMs for years. Members of the Snowflake AI Research team pioneered systems such as [ZeRO](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.02054) and [DeepSpeed](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed), [PagedAttention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06180)  [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm), and [LLM360](https://www.llm360.ai/) which significantly reduced the cost of LLM training and inference, and open sourced them to make LLMs more accessible and cost-effective for the community.\n\nToday, the Snowflake AI Research Team is thrilled to introduce Snowflake Arctic, a top-tier enterprise-focused LLM that pushes the frontiers of cost-effective training and openness. Arctic is** *****efficiently intelligent and truly open.***\n\n* **Efficiently Intelligent:** Arctic excels at enterprise tasks such as SQL generation, coding and instruction following benchmarks even when compared to open source models trained with significantly higher compute budgets. In fact, it sets a new baseline for cost-effective training to enable Snowflake customers to create high-quality custom models for their enterprise needs at a low cost.\n* **Truly Open:** Apache 2.0 license provides ungated access to weights and code. In addition, we are also open sourcing all of our data recipes and research insights.\n\nSnowflake Arctic is available from Hugging Face, NVIDIA API catalog and Replicate today or via your model garden or catalog of choice, including Snowflake Cortex, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, Lamini, Perplexity and Together over the coming days.\n\n![](https://www.snowflake.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/figure-1-training-efficiency-3.png)\nFig 1. Enterprise intelligence – average of Coding (HumanEval+ and MBPP+), SQL Generation (Spider), and Instruction following (IFEval) –  vs. Training cost\n\n### **Top-tier enterprise intelligence at incredibly low training cost**\n\nAt Snowflake, we see a consistent pattern in AI needs and use cases from our enterprise customers. Enterprises want to use LLMs to build conversational SQL data copilots, code copilots and RAG chatbots. From a metrics perspective, this translates to LLMs that excel at SQL, code, complex instruction following and the ability to produce grounded answers. We capture these abilities into a single metric we call **enterprise intelligence** by taking an average of Coding (HumanEval+ and MBPP+), SQL Generation (Spider) and Instruction following (IFEval).\n\nArctic offers top-tier enterprise intelligence among open source LLMs, and it does so using a training compute budget of roughly under \\$2 million (less than 3K GPU weeks). This means Arctic is more capable than other open source models trained with a similar compute budget. More importantly, it excels at enterprise intelligence, even when compared to those trained with a significantly higher compute budget. The high training efficiency of Arctic also means that Snowflake customers and the AI community at large can train custom models in a much more affordable way.\n\nAs seen in Figure 1, Arctic is on par or better than both LLAMA 3 8B and LLAMA 2 70B on enterprise metrics, while using less than ½ of the training compute budget. Similarly, despite using 17x less compute budget, Arctic is on par with Llama3 70B in enterprise metrics like Coding (HumanEval+ & MBPP+), SQL (Spider) and Instruction Following (IFEval). It does so while remaining competitive on overall performance. For example, despite using 7x less compute than DBRX it remains competitive on Language Understanding and Reasoning (a collection of 11 metrics) while being better in Math (GSM8K). For a detailed breakdown of results by individual benchmark, see the Metrics section.\n\n![](https://www.snowflake.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/table-1-4.png)\nTable 1 Model architecture and training compute for Arctic, Llama-2 70B, DBRX and Mixtral 8x22B.  Training compute is proportional to the product of active parameters and training tokens.\n\n### **Training efficiency**\n\nTo achieve this level of training efficiency, Arctic uses a unique Dense-MoE Hybrid transformer architecture. It combines a 10B dense transformer model with a residual 128×3.66B MoE MLP resulting in 480B total and 17B active parameters chosen using a top-2 gating. It was designed and trained using the following three key insights and innovations:\n\n1) ***Many-but-condensed experts with more expert choices:* In late 2021, the **[DeepSpeed team demonstrated](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05596) that MoE can be applied to auto-regressive LLMs to significantly improve model quality without increasing compute cost.\n\nIn designing Arctic, we noticed, based on the above, that the improvement of the model quality depended primarily on the number of experts and the total number of parameters in the MoE model, and the number of ways in which these experts can be combined together.\n\nBased on this insight, Arctic is designed to have 480B parameters spread across 128 fine-grained experts and uses top-2 gating to choose 17B active parameters. In contrast, recent MoE models are built with significantly fewer experts as shown in Table 2.  Intuitively, Arctic leverages a large number of total parameters and many experts to enlarge the model capacity for top-tier intelligence, while it judiciously chooses among many-but-condensed experts and engages a moderate number of active parameters for resource-efficient training and inference.\n\n![](https://www.snowflake.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/figure-2-Standard-MoE-Architecture-vs-Arctic-4.png)\nFigure 2. Standard MoE Architecture vs. Arctic\n\n2)*Architecture and System Co-design:* Training vanilla MoE architecture with a large number of experts is very inefficient even on the most powerful AI training hardware due to high all-to-all communication overhead among experts. However, it is possible to hide this overhead if the communication can be overlapped with computation.\n\nOur second insight is that combining a dense transformer with a residual MoE component (Fig 2) in the Arctic architecture enables our training system to achieve good training efficiency via communication computation overlap, hiding a big portion of the communication overhead.\n\n3)*Enterprise-Focused Data Curriculum:* Excelling at enterprise metrics like Code Generation and SQL requires a vastly different data curriculum than training models for generic metrics. Over hundreds of small-scale ablations, we learned that generic skills like common sense reasoning can be learned in the beginning, while more complex metrics like coding, math and SQL can be learned effectively towards the latter part of the training. One can draw analogies to human life and education, where we acquire capabilities from simpler to harder. As such, Arctic was trained with a three-stage curriculum each with a different data composition focusing on generic skills in the first phase (1T Tokens), and enterprise-focused skills in the latter two phases (1.5T and 1T tokens). A high-level summary of our dynamic curriculum is shown here.\n\n![](https://www.snowflake.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/table-2-4.png)\nTable 2. Dynamic data composition for three-phase training of Arctic with emphasis on enterprise intelligence.\n\n### **Inference efficiency**\n\n![](https://www.snowflake.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/figure-3-inference-efficiency-3.png)\nFigure 3. Enterprise intelligence – average of Coding (HumanEval+ and MBPP+), SQL Generation (Spider), and Instruction following (IFEval) vs. Active Parameters during Inference\n\nTraining efficiency represents only one side of the efficient intelligence of Arctic. Inference efficiency is equally critical to allow for the practical deployment of the model at a low cost. Arctic represents a leap in MoE model scale, using more experts and total parameters than any other open sourced auto-regressive MoE model. As such, several system insights and innovations are necessary to run inference on Arctic efficiently:\n\na) At interactive inference of a small batch size, e.g., batch size of 1, an MoE model’s inference latency is bottlenecked by the time it takes to read all the active parameters, where the inference is memory bandwidth bounded. At this batch size, Arctic (17B active parameters) can have up to 4x less memory reads than Code-Llama 70B, and up to 2.5x less than Mixtral 8x22B (44B active parameters), leading to faster inference performance.\n\nWe have collaborated with NVIDIA and worked with [NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-tensorrt-llm-supercharges-large-language-model-inference-on-nvidia-h100-gpus/) and the [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) teams to provide a preliminary implementation of Arctic for interactive inference. With FP8 quantization, we can fit Arctic within a single GPU node. While far from fully optimized, at a batch size of 1, Arctic has a throughput of over 70+ tokens/second for effective interactive serving.\n\nb) As the batch size increases significantly e.g., thousands of tokens per forward pass, Arctic switches from being memory bandwidth bound to compute bound, where the inference is bottlenecked by the active parameters per token. At this point, Arctic incurs 4x less compute than CodeLlama 70B and Llama 3 70B.\n\nTo enable compute bound inference and high relative throughput that corresponds to the small number of active parameters in Arctic (as shown in Fig 3), a large batch size is needed. Achieving this requires having enough KV cache memory to support the large batch size while also having enough memory to store nearly 500B parameters for the model. While challenging, this can be achieved with two-node inference using a combination of system optimizations such as FP8 weights, split-fuse and continuous batching, tensor parallelism within a node and pipeline parallelism across nodes.\n\nWe have worked closely with NVIDIA to optimize inference for  NVIDIA NIM microservices powered by TensorRT-LLM. In parallel, we are working with the vLLM community, and our in-house development team is also enabling efficient inference of Arctic for enterprise use cases in the coming weeks.\n\n### Truly open\n\nArctic was built upon the collective experiences of our diverse team, as well as major insights and learnings from the community. Open collaboration is key to innovation, and Arctic would not have been possible without open source code and open research insights from the community. We are thankful to the community and eager to give back our own learnings to enrich the collective knowledge and empower others to succeed.\n\nOur commitment to a truly open ecosystem goes beyond open weights and code but also having open research insights and open source recipes.\n\n#### Open research insights\n\nThe construction of Arctic has unfolded along two distinct trajectories: the open path, which we navigated swiftly thanks to the wealth of community insights, and the hard path, which is characterized by the segments of research that lacked prior community insights, necessitating intensive debugging and numerous ablations.\n\nWith this release, we’re not just unveiling the model; we’re also sharing our research insights through a comprehensive ‘cookbook’ that opens up our findings from the hard path. The cookbook is designed to expedite the learning process for anyone looking to build world-class MoE models. It offers a blend of high-level insights and granular technical details in crafting an LLM akin to Arctic so you can build your desired intelligence efficiently and economically — guided by the open path instead of the hard one.\n\nThe cookbook spans a breadth of topics, including pre-training, fine-tuning, inference and evaluation, and also delves into modeling, data, systems and infrastructure. You can preview [the table of contents](https://medium.com/@snowflake_ai_research/snowflake-arctic-cookbook-series-exploring-mixture-of-experts-moe-c7d6b8f14d16), which outlines over 20 subjects. We will be releasing corresponding Medium.com blog posts daily over the next month. For instance, we’ll disclose our strategies for sourcing and refining web data in “What data to use?”  We’ll discuss our data composition and curriculum in “How to compose data.” Our exploration of MoE architecture variations will be detailed in “Advanced MoE architecture,” discussing the co-design of model architecture and system performance. And for those curious about LLM evaluation, our “How to evaluate and compare model quality — less straightforward than you think” will shed light on the unexpected complexities we encountered.\n\nThrough this initiative, we aspire to contribute to an open community where collective learning and advancement are the norms to push the boundaries of this field further.\n\n#### Open source serving code\n\n* We are releasing model checkpoints for both the base and instruct-tuned versions of Arctic under an Apache 2.0 license. This means you can use them freely in your own research, prototypes and products.\n* Our LoRA-based fine-tuning pipeline, complete with a recipe, allows for efficient model tuning on a single node.\n* In collaboration with NVIDIA TensorRT-LLM and vLLM, we are developing initial inference implementations for Arctic, optimized for interactive use with a batch size of one. We are excited to work with the community to tackle the complexities of high-batch size inference of really large MoE models.\n* Arctic is trained using a 4K attention context window. We are developing an attention-sinks-based sliding window implementation to support unlimited sequence generation capability in the coming weeks. We look forward to working with the community to extend to a 32K attention window in the near future.\n\n##### Metrics\n\nOur focus from a metrics perspective is primarily on what we call **enterprise intelligence** metrics, a collection of skills that are critical for enterprise customers that includes, Coding (HumanEval+ and MBPP+), SQL Generation (Spider) and Instruction following (IFEval).\n\nAt the same time, it is equally important to evaluate LLMs on the metrics the research community evaluates them on. This includes world knowledge, common sense reasoning and math capabilities. We refer to these metrics as **academic benchmarks**​.\n\nHere is a comparison of Arctic with multiple open source models across enterprise and academic metrics:\n\n![](https://www.snowflake.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/figure-4-barchart-metrics-3-scaled.jpg)\n\nFor enterprise metrics, Arctic demonstrates top-tier performance compared to all other open source models regardless of the compute class. For other metrics, it achieves top-tier performance at its compute class and even remains competitive with models trained with higher compute budgets. Snowflake Arctic is the best open source model for off-the-shelf enterprise use cases. And if you are looking to train your own model from scratch at the lowest total cost of ownership (TCO), the training infrastructure and systems optimization descriptions in our cookbook should be of great interest.\n\nFor academic benchmarks, there has been a focus on world knowledge metrics such as MMLU to represent model performance. With high-quality web and STEM data, MMLU monotonically moves up as a function of training FLOPS. Since one objective for Arctic was to optimize for training efficiency while keeping the training budget small, a natural consequence is lower MMLU performance compared to recent top-tier models. In line with this insight, we expect our ongoing training run at a higher training compute budget than Arctic to exceed Arctic’s MMLU performance. We note that performance on MMLU world knowledge doesn’t necessarily correlate with our focus on enterprise intelligence.\n\n![](https://www.snowflake.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/table-3-5.png)\nTable 3.
