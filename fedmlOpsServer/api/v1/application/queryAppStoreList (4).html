Further details regarding the technical capabilities of the model can be found in our [research paper](https://stability.ai/research/stable-video-diffusion-scaling-latent-video-diffusion-models-to-large-datasets).\n\n\\*\\*Adaptable to Numerous Video Applications\\*\\*\n\nOur video model can be easily adapted to various downstream tasks, including multi-view synthesis from a single image with finetuning on multi-view datasets. We are planning a variety of models that build on and extend this base, similar to the ecosystem that has built around stable diffusion.\n\nSample multi-view generations from our finetuned video model\n\nIn addition, today, you can sign up for our waitlist [here](https://stability.ai/contact) to access a new upcoming web experience featuring a Text-To-Video interface. This tool showcases the practical applications of Stable Video Diffusion in numerous sectors, including Advertising, Education, Entertainment, and beyond.\n\n<iframe width=\"200\" height=\"113\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/G7mihAy691g?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen=\"\" title=\"Stable Video Diffusion\" id=\"yui\\_3\\_17\\_2\\_1\\_1711754052756\\_85\" data-gtm-yt-inspected-12=\"true\"></iframe>\n\n\\*\\*Competitive in Performance\\*\\*\n\nStable Video Diffusion is released in the form of two image-to-video models, capable of generating 14 and 25 frames at customizable frame rates between 3 and 30 frames per second. At the time of release in their foundational form, through external evaluation, we have found these models surpass the leading closed models in user preference studies.\n\n![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/6213c340453c3f502425776e/02e26394-e36b-4399-bacf-fea2bb26f6bd/Graph+SVD+v+Competition0.jpg)\n\n\\*\\*Exclusively for Research\\*\\*\n\nWhile we eagerly update our models with the latest advancements and work to incorporate your feedback, we emphasize that this model is not intended for real-world or commercial applications at this stage. Your insights and feedback on safety and quality are important to refining this model for its eventual release.\n\nThis aligns with our previous releases in new modalities, and we look forward to sharing the full release with you all.\n\n\\*\\*Our Ever-Expanding Suite of AI Models\\*\\*\n\nStable Video Diffusion is a proud addition to our diverse range of open-source models.

It is an auto-regressive language model, based on the transformer architecture. In other words, it is an multi-modal version of LLMs fine-tuned for chat / instructions.\n\nThe LLaVa model was proposed in **[Visual Instruction Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08485) and improved in **[Improved Baselines with Visual Instruction Tuning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.03744)by Haotian Liu, Chunyuan Li, Yuheng Li and Yong Jae Lee.\n\nThe abstract from the paper is the following:\n\n*Large multimodal models (LMM) have recently shown encouraging progress with visual instruction tuning. In this note, we show that the fully-connected vision-language cross-modal connector in LLaVA is surprisingly powerful and data-efficient. With simple modifications to LLaVA, namely, using CLIP-ViT-L-336px with an MLP projection and adding academic-task-oriented VQA data with simple response formatting prompts, we establish stronger baselines that achieve state-of-the-art across 11 benchmarks. Our final 13B checkpoint uses merely 1.2M publicly available data, and finishes full training in ∼1 day on a single 8-A100 node. We hope this can make state-of-the-art LMM research more accessible.*\n\n![https://fedml.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/1710304224153llava_architecture.jpg](https://fedml.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/1710304224153llava_architecture.jpg)\n\nLLaVa architecture.
